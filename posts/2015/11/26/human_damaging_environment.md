Q. Explain some of the ways in which human are damaging the environment. What can governments do to address these problems? What can individual people do?


Environment has been with us before human being appeared on the earth.  we cannot live without the environment and the quality of life is heavly dependent on the state of environment. I want to discuss about what we can do to preserve and maintain this important environment in terms of the perspective of governments and individual people.

From the government point of view, the most imminent task is to strengthen the level of punishment against the company which violate the law of environment and review or reexamine any plausible damage to the environment in developing the country. The punishment for breaking the law for protecting environment seems to be not severe enough to deter the rising number of events on giving negative impact on our environment. In addition to this, some of the policies to develop the countries is actually causing many environmental issues because of the reckless public officials' careless plan without much consideration of invironmental impact.

Another approach to make our environment better from the perspective of individual people is to reduce waste as much as possible as well as find a way to recycle the wastes. Most of products we are consuming on a daily basis can be recycled if we make a little effort. First of all, the pack of milk made of papter which can be easily recyclable and the most of plastic back given in super market to carry the bought items also can be a good item for the purpose of recycling. Those effort will inevitably lead to reducing the amount of waste, which definitely will be conducive to our environment.

To sum up, as we can see in the above arguments, there are two components which are required to protect and enhance our environment. These two players are indispensable to the environment since they are the one which are the biggest concern to the environment as well as have the most enfluential role to manage the environment.
