Q. Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

At these days, some people believe that the pace of the disappearance of languages is quite alarming whereas other people is convinced that the matter is not worrisome issue since they believe there is some benefit we can expect from the phenomenon such as less burden to learn the decreased number of languages. However I personally believe that it is quite rediculous idea that we should welcome the circumstance of disappearing languages because we will be less stressful from the learning of languages.

First of all, the biggest problem we encounter from the languages disappearance is that we are losing the medium to understand other ethnic group' culture and tradition. Most of civilization leave their the most precious knowledge and experience in the form of character. If we failed to preserve their own languages, there is no other way to obtain their the most valuable cultural heritage. There are many cases that we cannot interpreset ancestor's monuments since we do not have the ancestor's language.
