Q. Teenagers are highly influenced by their friends. There is a term called 'peer pressure' meaning that a child is forced to behave in a manner that is acceptable to his/her friends. These behaviors may range from simple dress codes to drinking and smoking.
What can parents do to make sure that their children do not give in to peer pressure?
Explain and/or give examples of situations.



Teenagers are very susceptible to the opinion or thought by their friends. They are very cautious and sensitive in expressing themselves since they constantly pay much attention to their friends' judgement or reaction with regard to their behaviors.  In this essay, I will explain what parents are able to make their kids be free from the influence from their peer.

Firstly, I believe the first thing parents have to do to overcome the difficulty 'peer pressures' their kids are encountering in their school is that they have to bolster their children's confidence and self esteem.  There are several researches to prove that people who are less influenced by their friends usually have a tendency to have a strong confidence and self esteem. For instance, when I was middle school student, I had a very low self esteem. My main decison criteria was always what my friends think and feel since I felt that my friends' judgement seems to be superior to mine.

Secondly, parents need to teach their kids that there is no way to please all people around them. Teenagers usually want to make a good relationship with their friends. In doing so, they have to keep considering their friends' need and

have more time to talk with their childs since most of kids who are easily influenced by their peers are usually experiencing the lack of affirmative response from their parents. For example, one of my friends in high school had some problem in deciding something and easily changed his mind by what his friends said or felt.
