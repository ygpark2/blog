Q. Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Some people believe that there should be no difference in the number of students in every subject regardless of their sexuality. However I personally believe if we focus on the equality of sex too much, we might have to sacrifice some the of values that we want to achieve through university education. I will highlight the values we can obtain in favor of the gender inequliaty in university.

Firstly, assuming that universities are obliged to accept people in equal proportion between men and women irrespective of their ability or competiveness, we probably have to punish people who are more competive than the people who obtain the admission from an university because of gender equality.
