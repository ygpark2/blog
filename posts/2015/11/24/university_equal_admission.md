Q. Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Some people believe that there should be no difference in the number of students in every subject regardless of their sexuality. However I personally believe if we focus on the equality of sex too much, we might have to sacrifice some the of values that we want to achieve through university education. I will highlight the values we can obtain in favor of the gender inequliaty in university.

Firstly, assuming that universities are obliged to accept people in equal proportion between men and women irrespective of their ability or competiveness with regard to study, we might punish the people who are more competive people because of gender equality. For example, a person who had a very high arcadmic capability  might have to give up the chance to develop his or her career to conduct further study in higher education. The less capable person in study will gain an admission from university thanks to the consideration to allocate equal ratio between men and women, which ultimately lead to making our education system worser and demotivating smart people to study in university.


Secondly, we have many universities allowed to give a chance for femail only to study in Korea. If the argument that universities should consider the students' gender in selecting students is justified, we are basically denying the justificationn of thouse universities' existence since they fail to meet the very important requirement to accept equal gender ratio of students. However, thouse universities are showing a good academic achievement in teaching students and research a subject with only female students. From this case, we can see there is no corelation between the same number of men and women students and the consideration of gender equality in university will undermine the competiveness of university.


In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that we should abolish any constraints to restrict the admission of university because of their gender. If we not take any action to prevent this absurd regulation, we might have to face a disaster that people start to disregard the university and nobody want to pursue a study in higher education system.
