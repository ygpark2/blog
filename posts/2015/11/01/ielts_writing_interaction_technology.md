Q. Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.
In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make?
Has this become a positive or negative development?


There is no denying that technology has been an indispensible element in our communication tools. As technology is becomeing more advanced, it has brought a significant change in the way people make a relationships. In this essay, I want to examine what impact it has brought.

First of all, the appearance of smart phone has brought a tremendous change in the way of people's communication.  Especially the programs such as Skype, Facebook and Twitter allow people to give many opportunities to meet your acquaintances, who you have known once, easily using the mechanism of following and follwer. For example, I have made a connection with a person who I knew in my workplace in Facebook. Accidently I came across his firends list on his Facebook and luckily I could find one my old friends who graduated at the same elementary school. Thanks to Facebook, I could meet again with my beloved friend and know other firends news as well through him.

On the other hand, we tend to rely heavily on the convenience of such technology, which will, I believe, lead to make the relationship vunerable since there is no consistent relationship without a constant effort to sustain the relationship. For instance, I have made several friends, when I travel abroad countries and I collected their email and Skype account since I believe that I can continuously maintain the relationship utilizing the technology. However, the convenience does not give a motivation to me. Furthermore, the belief that I can connect with them through the technology make me neglect endeavor to communicate with them, which naturally result in losing the friends.

In conclusion, the relationship we are making using technology can be beneficially as long as we are carefully using the advantages of technology. However we should also be cautious in adopting the technology for the purpose of making relationships since it might bring some undesirable result.
