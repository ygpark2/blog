### Problem 45

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	     Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal	 	 Pn=n(3n−1)/2	 	  1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	 	  Hn=n(2n−1)	 	     1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

### Solution

import Data.List

let t x = x*(x+1)/2
let p x = x*(3*x-1)/2
let h x = x*(2*x-1)

filter (\x -> p(x) `elemIndex` [t x | x <- [1..500]] /= Nothing) [1..500]



### Problem 46

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×1^2
15 = 7 + 2×2^2
21 = 3 + 2×3^2
25 = 7 + 2×3^2
27 = 19 + 2×2^2
33 = 31 + 2×1^2

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

### Solution

import Data.List.Split -- splitOn

let square x y = map (\z -> x + 2^z) [1..y]

map (\x -> square x) $ filter isPrime [1..100]

map (`div` 2) $ map (21-) $ filter isPrime [1..21]

 [sqrt(fromIntegral(25-x)/2) | x <- [1..25], isPrime x]

filter (\x -> last(splitOn "." x) == "0") [show(sqrt(fromIntegral(25-x)/2)) | x <- [1..25], isPrime x]

let validateOdd z = filter (\x -> last(splitOn "." x) == "0") [show(sqrt(fromIntegral(z-x)/2)) | x <- [1..z], isPrime x]

filter (\x -> length(validateOdd(x)) == 0) [x | x <- [1..10000], (not . isPrime) x, odd x]

### Problem 47

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors. What is the first of these numbers?

### Solution

import Data.List.Split -- chunksOf
import  Data.List.Grouping -- splitEvery

let divisors x = 1:[ y | y <- [2..(x `div` 2)], x `mod` y == 0] ++ [x]

let isPrime x = divisors x == [1,x]

filter (\ x -> (sum(x) - head(x) * 4) == 4) $ chunksOf 4 $ take 10000 [n | n <- [1..], (length $ filter isPrime $ divisors n) == 5]
