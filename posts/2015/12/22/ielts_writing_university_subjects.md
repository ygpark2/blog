Q. Some people think that all university students should study whatever they like. Others believe that they sholud only be allowed to study subjects that will be useful in the future, such as those related to science and technology.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.


The biggest concern for all university students is which subject they need to choose since the chosen subject will determine the type of job they work after graduation. Some people think they have to study the subject they want to study in university while others believe they need to approach more strategically in selecting the major which is more popular in the society, which will lead to the great likelihood for them to get a job. I will comtemplate these point of views and add my thought on that in this essay.


First of all, there is no doubt that the subject they study in university is very critical in students' life. Accordingly many people want to study the major they like as they will be more likely to show better performance in their favorable subject rather than the subjects in which they are not interested. For example, my friend who have a strong talent in painting pursued his art study in university. Not surprisingly, he have made a tremendous success as a painter and he always attributed his success to a decision he made to keep developing his inherent talent.

On the other hand, the argument that students should pay more attention to the practicality of the subject they study in university seems to be not very convincible. Basically the argument is based on the assumption that the more practical major will lead you to the higher likelihood to secure your job in the future. However it is quite doubtful that you are able to draw a good result in the field at which you are not good. Thus I believe students should follow their preference on the subject, which will eventually help you to build a successful career.


In summary, the belief that students should study the subject they like seems to outweigh the benefits which we can expect by selecting the popular or more demanded subject from the society. Thus it is very encouraging that we make an effort to cultivate an environment for students to pusue the subject they like.
