Q. Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.


The view of cultural differences has been the controversial issue amongst people. Some people believe that visitors need to respect or abide by the local rules or tradition whereas other people believe that the country need to show more leniency to foreigners. I will contemplate both perspectives and add comment to the reasoned conclusion.

Firstly, as many people travel abroad thanks to the technical advances in aviation industry leading to lower the cost of flying, they will frequently encounter some difficulties that resulted in the cultural difference in foreign countries where they are traveling. Obvioulsy the first impression they perceive in those countries will be embarrassment for most people in such cases. Thus the most effective way to minimize or ease the awkward circumstances is to learn the country, which you are about to travel, with regard to their culture and tradition  in advance. Furthermore, it will help you to understand the country more deeply and enrich your traveling experience.

On the flip side, when it comes to the underdeveloped countries, foreign tourists are accounting for the main source of their income. In such cases, they seem to be more lenient for the visitors since their living need to heavily rely on the tourists' expense. If you travel in those countries, you might encounter the unexpected hospitality from the local people who want your money. Thus I think the welcomeness the host country has shown is sometime resulted from the economic motivation rather than their pure mind to be friendly for the foreigners.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that cultural differences are becomeing more crucial than ever before as our society is becomming globalized. Sometime we can be visitor to other countries and another time we can be a host for the foreign traveller. The most important thing we need to bear in mind is that we have to take the cultural difference for granted and embrace it since it is very natural part of our life.
