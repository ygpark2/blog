Q. Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.


The view of cultural differences has been the controversial issue amongst people. Some people believe that visitors need to respect or abide by the local rules or tradition whereas other people believe that the country need to show more leniency to foreigners. I will contemplate both perspectives and add comment to the reasoned conclusion.

Firstly, as many people travel abroad thanks to the technical advances in aviation industry leading to lower the cost of flying , they will frequently encounter some difficulties that resulted in the cultural difference in foreign countries where they are traveling. Obvioulsy the first response will be embarrassment for most people in such cases. Thus the most effective way to minimize or ease the awkward circumstances is to learn the country, which you are about to travel, with regard to their culture and tradition  in advance. Furthermore, it will help you to understand the country more deeply and enrich your travel.

On the flip side, when it comes to the underdeveloped countries, foreign tourists are accounting for the main resource of their income. In such cases, they seem to be more lenient for the visitors since their living need to heavily rely on the tourists' expense. However if you try to take advantage of their attitude toward foreign tourists, it might cause an unwanted trouble, For instance, when I travel middle east countries, I freely took pictures of a woman who wear a hijab. The woman called police to accuse me of taking the picture of her. I did not know that it is strictly prohibited to take a picture of woman in middle east countries.

In conclusion,
