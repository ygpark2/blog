Q.Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.

As the world is becomming smaller thanks to globalization, people have a tendency to use only the languages which can be communicated globaly. Some people believe that a government's intervention to deter the phenomenon of the disapearing languages is necessarily whereas other people argue that we can do many important matters which is much more crucial than the prevention of languages' extinction. I believe that the goverment have to invest public money to develop polocies to protect the disappearance of languages.

First of all, the argument that the goverment's effort to save the languages spoken by minorities is wasteful do not make sense as the language is the most prominent invention human being developed. Supposing that we do not have such a minor language, basically we are denying and destroying  every legacy the people of speaking the language developed. It is quite lamentable that the goverment do not take any action to preserve the minor languages which enrich our cultural variety and provide some precious knowledge to our next genrations to come.

On the other hand, basically the money we collected from people under the name of tax is supposed to spend for enhancing the public welfare. I cannot find any other option except the spent money for preserving the languagates in dager of disappearing since this will definately flourish our culture and extend our capacity of taking care of minorities eventually. Thus I strongly support the idea that we should persist the effort to preserve the disapearing languages and reach a consensus with regard to investing money on prevention of languages extinction since the money is based on tax payer's money.

In summary, I believe the goverment need to take this issue seriously and raise public awareness about this issue so that more people can pay attention to this issue. As the public interests are growing rapidly, the solution for the problem of preserving the disapearing languages will be easily found or the task to achieve the goal will be relatively easier.
