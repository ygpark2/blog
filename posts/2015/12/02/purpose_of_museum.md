Q. Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

The purpose of museums has been quite controversial since the understanding of the purpose is sharply contrast amongst people. Some people believe that we need to fortify the role of education in museum whereas other people think that the entertainment purpose should be prioritized admong other roles. In this essay, I want to weigh the both views and add my thought about the issue.

It is widely considered that the paramount role of museum is to provide a variety of information about our ancestor to people as well as to record our present generation's thought and living style in order to give a lesson to our next generation to come. This is the main reason why many schools harness the museum as a place to teach students. However, if we put too much stress on the role of education in museum, people will be easily losing their interesting, which come to the place where most people is very not keen to go very frequently. Thus I believe we need to come up with measures to encourage the students to learn many lessons or obtain valuable information without compromising their interest.

On the other hand, there is very strong tendency to utilize musuems as a place to hold many cultural performance events as the museum is quite suitable place to serve that purpose. As this kind of events are increasing, people often apt to forget why they come to the museum and only focus on the enjoyment the events give. I do not oppose the function of museum to give pleasure people through various mediums. However, if we lose the main purpose the museum, which is education, by mesmerizing those pleasures. we are actully denying the original reason for the existence of the museum.

In summary, museum is able to server a variety of purposes as long as it is faithfully serving the original role to educate people and preserve the legacy. Therefore, we need to be vigilant in order not to confuse the original functionalities of museum.
