Q. Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.


Most people struggle with change even if it is for the better, especially old people. Not all the changes were successful but we learned from the failures too. However, some people still believe any change will not be favorable to their life so that they strongly resist chnage. I will discuss both perspectives and add my thought on the matter.


First of all, people who love to encounter change usually have had a number of good memories about change and these good memories are instensifying their favorable behaviour or decision toward change.  For example, when I was an university student, IT technology was very popular and many expert predict that the IT jobs will be promising. On that account, I made up my mind to change my major from public adminitration to information communication technology and I am very content with the decision that I made at that time. This good consequence of the change seems to reinforce my action to positively react to change.


On the other hand, it is very obvious that most people do not want to embrace change. The paramount reason for people to resist to the change is that they do not want to face uncertanities in which the change might bring. For instance, when they are compelled to adapt to the new technology in the company they are working, they will be highly likely to dislike the situation since they are not sure about how much they can perform in the new field. Basically, they are not happy with  the uncertainty inherent the circumstances

In conclusion, we can easily observe that there are two response patterns toward change. The first one is to welcome any change that they face since they have an accumulated positive experiences from many change they had. The other one is to resist change because they dislike the fear and anxiousness in which those change might bring. I personally believe that the change will bring more benefit in our life and we have thrived thank to the innovation in which the change result.
