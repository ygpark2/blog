Q. Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world.
Do you think this is a positive or negative development?


There is no doubt that we can buy the similar or identical items in any countries you travelled since the globalized companies are designing and producing the same model and distribute it to the world. Some people believe that it is quite lucrative development in terms of the cost effectiveness while other insist that it will be detrimental to human diversity. In this essay, I argue that using globalized products seems to have more adverse effect on people.

First of all, the identical products are everywhere in the world thanks to the global company and the advancement of ecommerce technology. Owing to these technological advancement and many such big global companies, the local shops seems to be losing their market share in their own countries. For example, Amazon is the biggest online store in the world. As Amazon provide the similar products at the very low price with heavy investment in advertisement, it is natural to expect the local and small companies will be hard to survive in such a harsh competition. Therefore, it will lead to the situation where most of local shops are disappearing, which is definately harmful to the country' economy.


Secondly, as more people purchase the similar products thanks to the low price, the local shops which produce traditional products will have to encounter an economically hard time. A recent survey conducted by Korea Development Bank has shown that people have a strong tendency to buy the product produced by global company rather than the product made in Korea because the global company have foster that the image of buying their product is much more fancy or attractive by investing huge amount of money to such advertisement. Thus it is not very desirable for people to only pursue the image manipulated by global company in favor of their profit.

In conclusion, the disadvantages from purchasing the identical products seems to outweigh the advantages we can expect from many aspects. Hence, we need to make an effort to protect out local business, which can contribute to job creation, and traditional products.
