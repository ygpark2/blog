Q. In many countries, the amount of crime is increasing. What do you think are the main causes  of crime? How can we deal with those causes?


Over the last fifty years, almost every country has experienced an enormous increase in crime rates. As the rates of crime rise, people start to pay special attention to the cause and solution for it. In this essay, I will examine the possible causes and solutions for the crimes

The first reason of the high rates of crime is the negative influence of commercialized mass media, Publishers of books or program producers are more concerned about the profit than the quality of the program they made. Thus books or movies might have negative effects on children if they only focus on the profit. As a result, the children will be more likely to be exposed constantly to violence or bad and dirty ideas through such books or films. Those people are apt to confuse what is socially acceptable behaviour and what is not, and hence easily commit a crime, which contribute the increasing crime rate.

When it comes to the solutions for the increasing crime rate, I believe the best and most effective way to protect our children from these harmful contents is to actively adopt a policy to regulate the mass media prioritizing their profit over the detrimental impact on people. In order to achieve this goal, we need to set a concrete rule to prohibit children from being exposed to the violent and sexual videos or cartoons without parent's proper guidance. Moreover, we need to strengthen the punishment for the companies which violated the rule for pursuing their own profit. These are the solutions of which we can think for tackling the problems caused by the company only prioritize their economic profit.

In conclusion, I have examined the cause and solution for the increasing crime. The biggest reason for the increasingly high rates of crime is the commercialized mass media prioritizing their own interest. Therefore, it is meaningful effort to regulate the reckless mass media which might be detrimental due to the contents they produced.
