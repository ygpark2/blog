Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programms (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children) What extent do you agree or disagree?


Some of the essential services in our community will not work properly without volunteers' dedicated effort. I believe such volunteers have been educated about how important their works are and experienced how much pleasure they will receive in return for their work. Thus I totally agree with the idea to include the social service program to high school curriculum.

Firstly, we need to dwell on the several benefit from enforcing the course to ask the high school students to do social service.
