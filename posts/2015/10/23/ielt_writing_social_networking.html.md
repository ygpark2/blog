# Many people believe that social networking sites ( such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extend do you agree?

The vast majority of people are convinced that the increasing number of social networking sites seems to have side effect on people as well as society in terms of a variety of aspect. However, there are a few people still believe that the online networking application have encourage people to meet a new person and facilitated the connection between people. My argument about this issue is that we need to maximize the benefits such sites can bring about and minimize the negative effects they might incur.

The first good point we can obtain in using those sites is that they actually make it easier to meet an unknown person. To elaborate more, as the society is more specialized, people are experiencing meeting new people within their speciality boundary. For example we have to spend most of our time in our workplace, it is quite hard to imagine that we á…Ÿare highly like to meet new people who are totally unrelated with our job. Thus, at these days, the sites are the only channel we can utilize to broaden our social relationship.

Another positive aspect of harnessing those sites is that especially the society which is suffering due to low birth rate might be able to overcome the issue easily through those sites. For instance, as more people take advantage ot the sites, the number of marriage couple will naturally increase thanks to the sites, which will eventually lead to the high birth rate. Therefore the society need to make an effort to raise an awareness of those sites and encourage them to use more frequently.

In conclusion, we can conclude that the social networking sites seems to be beneficially not only to our society but also to individuals
