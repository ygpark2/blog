The importance of learning a foreign language is increasing, as the globalizatio nis expedited in many countries. In this trend, some language master argue that foreign language education should be taught at primary school in stead of secondary school to maximize the effectiveness of the education of language learning. However, I believe that secondary school is the best time to teach foreign language because we can expect more benefits.

The first advantage of teaching foreign language at secondary school is that the students can easily understand the meaning of foreign word thanks to their concrete and abundant mother tongue's vocabulary. If you teach foreign language to a primary student who is not fully developed his or her navive language, it will be extremly hard because he or she cannot understand a new foreign word which he or she never learnt the corresponding word in his or her mother tongue. In addition to this, adding new language to their premature mother tongue will not only deter the development of their mother tongue but also be not helpful to learn a foreign language beased on their fragile mother tongue.

On contrary, if we teach a foreign language from elementary school, we can easily find many drawbacks. The first thing among them is that to teach foreign language to elementary studentswill be not only hard but not useful since it will be extremely difficult to motivate students who are still having trouble to understand their own language. Secondary, the early starting of teaching foreign language will destroy their interest as to foreign language, which will lead people to the stage of abandoning

To sum up, the disadvantages we expect from the teaching foreign language in elementary school seems to outweigh the advantages we can obtain from secondary school.
