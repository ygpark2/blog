Art has been essential element of any human society from prehistoric times. However, at these days, the unprecedented technology development seems to undermine the value of art in human growth. I personally believe that art seems to be undervalued that is should deserve and we need to find a way to promote to the education of art in our public school.

First of all, as the increasing importance of creativity in many areas is receiving more attention, people tend to pay more attention to how to enhance their creativity. The most effective method to develop creativity has been  the education of art since we can easily find the most creative person among the artists. In addition to this, art can also be used to cure a person who are psychologically damaged. Therefore, we can expect the benefits in terms of psychological aspect as well as develping creativity.

Even though the critical importance of art has been recoginized by an increasing number of people, the recognition with regard to art in our education system seems to be out of tune with public concerns. A big portion of our time in schools has been dedicated to teach other subjects by neglecting to spend more time to teach art. Furthermore, the exam to determine their ability to study in university to not include art subject, which eventually discourage students to study art.

In conclusion, we are living in the society or the education system that make little account of art subject. However, we have to build up a strong art education to foster more creative person.
