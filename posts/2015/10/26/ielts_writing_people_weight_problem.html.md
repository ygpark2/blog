Q. Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?
What other measures do you think might be effective?


Global warming and traffic jam, we are facing in our daily life, has received notable attention from many countries, which is believed to be caused by the sharply increasing the number of car on roads. Many people believe the price level of petrol is very cheap, which it stimulate people to buy more car.  However I do not believe the petrol price is the only reason to aggravate the problems. I will examine what other measures can be considered to prevent the escalating pollution and traffic jam.

First of all, no one can deny that there is a close correlation between the price level of petrol and the escalating traffic jam and worsening pollution. However, it is quite naive belief that we are able to curb the number of cars and the pollution by solely controlling the price of petrol. Some of the people who are rich enough do not really care the price of petrol. Therefore I cannot trust such belief the price level of petrol will decisively determine the impact of traffic and pollution issues.

Secondly, the other measures to tackle those issues except setting the price of petrol are to levy a high tax on the buyer of the cars and to apply high tax rate to petrol. The money collected from the buyer under the name of tax should be invested to build new roads to lessen the traffic jam and to eliminate the bottleneck. In addition to this, the company to develop the equipment to clean the polluted air should be given incentives in terms of funding for research and development. Thus these methods will contribute significantly to contain the

In conclusion, as I examine the limited impact of price control for petrol against traffic and polution problems, we cannot solve the issues by only relying on the high price of petrol. Therefore we have to find a combined strategy to tackle the problems effectively and enhance the quality of human life.
