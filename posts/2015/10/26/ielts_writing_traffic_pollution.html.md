Q. In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing.
What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?


Many countries have struggled to tackle the issue caused by high health care cost for the people who are suffering due to obesity. In this essay I will analyse the causes about why this trend is worsening and what measures we can take to alleviate or eradicate the problems of deteriorated people's health.

The foremost reason for obesity is food. Especially, instant food is regarded as the main causes to aggravate the health of people. Owing to the convenience and the relatively cheap price of the instant food, people is inclined to eat quite frequently , which result in obesity related disease. Another reason might be the intake of too much sugar. A recent report analysing the amount of sugar people consume daily said that the level of people's consumption is dangerous and suggested that the public health authority need to take prompt action to curb the trend otherwise the society will have to pay a tremendous amount of cost to manage diabetes.

One of the measures I can think of to deter the worsening health issue among people is to raise awareness of the severe consequence of failing to manage their health due to their reckless eating habit. Additionaly, building many fitness centers which are adjacent to people's resident area will naturally lead to increase the likelihood of exercise. These methods will bring some meaningful change to the current tendency to improve the continously increasing the average weight of people.

In summary, the reasons that I mentioned above are needed to be taken into further consideration to improve the problems of aggravating health and suggested measures should be implemented without hesitation to achieve the goal of maintaing people's sound body.
