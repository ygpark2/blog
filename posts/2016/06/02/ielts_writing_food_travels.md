Is this a positive or negative trend?


Nowadays, most of food we eat everyday is comming from thousands miles away even though some identical local food is available for purchasing. In this essay, I will dwell on why it is consistent and examine what impact it brought to our lives.

First of all, technological advances in food transportation along with cheap oil price have allowed food industry to move greater quantities of food faster and over longer distances than ever before. More specifically, air transportation, high-speed rails and a cold-storage car are the ones which enable food to travel such a long distance. In addition to this, the high demand for food in a such densely populated city is a driving force to precipitate these technological development because locally grown food cannot meet such a high demand. Accordingly, it is inevitable to use those technological advancement to unravel the food shortage problem in such densely populated cities.


It is clear that this change has brought many negative effects to our lives in many respects. One ot the most detrimental effects is that most of food relying on long journey have to be processed with much toxic checmical to preserve the freshness of the products or prevent the food from decay. Such process will also cause many unexpected problems such as diseases caused by intake of the food, additional environmental contamination from the checmical process of the food. Additionally, the transportation of the food will also contribute to the aggravating global warming issue, since the food need to be delivered from the place it grow to a city in which most of consumer live.


In summary, the two most important factors, which are technological advances and food shortage in a densely populated city, are the main contributors to make this trend feasible. In my opinion, such trend seems to have many adverse effects and thus it is desirable to encourage people to consume more locally grown food and curtail the increasing population in a city.
