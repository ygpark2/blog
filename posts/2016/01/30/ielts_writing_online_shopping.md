Internet has hugely affected the life style of human being. In particular, when it comes to the online shopping, the tremendous change of the of consumer's shopping pattern have been unprecedented. In this essay, I will delineate benefits and losses ecommerce might bring.

First of all, nobody cannot deny the fact that online shopping have been providing the convenience to many customers. Furthermore, the convenience of ecommerce is the main competitiveness in competing with offline market. For example, supposing you visit Amazon web site, you can virtually purchase any product you can imagine and you can also easily compare the price as well for the identical product. I believe this is the biggest advantage we can expect from Internet shopping.

On the other hand, one giant company such as Amazon, Auction and Ebay jeopardize many local markets, which lead to devastating local economy. Many people have to lose their job due to those giant companies price competitiveness because those big companies can harness their purchasing power to reduce the price of product whereas it is not feasible to those local small shops. Thus many local shops have to close their business, which result in dismissing many employees.

In summary, Internet shopping is a huge step forward in the human being's shopping style. However it also brought many brigh and dark sides as well to people's life. Some people gain some benefit while some people have to bear some loss from this change. Therefore, we need to come up with a measure to balance those losses and benefits from the change online shopping brought.
