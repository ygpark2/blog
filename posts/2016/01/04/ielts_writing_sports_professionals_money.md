Q. Successful sports professionals can earn a great deal more money than people in other important professions.
Some people think this is fully justified while others think it is unfair.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.


At these days, the news that many popular sports stars had made a great deal with the famous sports club can be seen quite frequently on the newspapers while other crucial professions are still make less money comparing to those sports star. Some people think that the incomparable money that sports professionals was making seems to be justifiable while some people strongly support the idea that such discrepancy is not acceptable. In this essay I will look into both views and add my thought on those views.

First of all, the argument that the most famous sports professions deserve what they are paid now is because we consider their effort and time to reach a top position through many severe competitions. In addition to this, as most of sports' career duration is relatively short in comparison with other occupations, we need to compensate more generously for the loss caused by the sports players' relatively short career span. Thus it is reasonable that we should pay highly to those of top sports players.

On the flip side of the coin, there is a viewpoint that other important occupations, such as doctor, lawyer and professor, also need to be paid well as well, since their contribution to our society or our well being cannot be underestimated. Moreover, it is hard to say that their dedication and endeavor to obtain such an important professions is less than the sport professions' one. Therefore, we also need to come up with measures to make up for their excellence.


On conclusion, I believe that most of people who are working in our society are not properly treated, considering their effort and contribution. Therefore, we need to find a way to boost their morale by introducing a method to allocate more resources to the people regardless of their occupations.
