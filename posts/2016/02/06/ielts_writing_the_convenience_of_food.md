Thanks to the rapid social change, people did not seem to invest enough time to prepare food since they have to repond so many tasks at the same time. In this situation, the first thing they sacrifice is the time to have or prepare a meal, which resulted in the surge of instant foods. In this essay, I argue that people need to have more time to have a meal and to think that the time to have a meal is very important part of their life.


One evident benefit of having an instant food is that we can save time to cook and prepare ingredients for a meal. As a result, they can do other tasks with those saved time. It is the main reason why people want to consume an instant food in the rapidly changing modern society. Another reason of people having a preferance for the convenience food is that they are constantly exposed to those food from early age. Because their parent also cannot afford to prepare a meal for their kids due to their busy job. Accordingly, the kids who was raised in this environment naturally tend to favor the instant food. Thus we can naturally encounter the surge of the number of people who are enjoying the instant food.


On the other hand, the biggest disadvantage people can expect from the habbit of having convenience food regularly is that they might undermine their health seriously. It has been a common knowledge that instant food is the main reason of causing many serious health problems. For instance, one decide to experiment himself to prove how bad the instant food is. What he did in the experiment is that he only take instant hamburger and coke for a couple of months and posted the video captured the progress of this body caused by instant food on Youtube. One month later, he checked his body from doctor. The doctor strongly recommended that he should quit the experiment as soon as possible since the test might destroy his whole life irreparably.
