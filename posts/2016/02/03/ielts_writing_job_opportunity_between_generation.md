 Companaies should encourage old employees (55 years old or above) to retire in order to give opportunities to the new generation. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the ideas.


Many companaies want to dismiss old employees due to their high salaries and strong resistence to the change which sometimes make the company precarious. Thus some companaies hire more youth employees instead of old experienced people while prompting old employees to retire so that they can invigorate the company. However, I am strongly convinced that old people should be maintained and treated well in the company since it will bring many benefits to the company.


The first main reason of paying respect to experienced employees is that the young generation who are about to work in the company will envisage their future from the life of the old employees in that company. If the old employees' life is not very desirable from the sight of young employees, they are more likely to work less and try to find an alternative way to ensure their uncertain future as they cannot find bright future from their upper generation. Hence, providing job security and good compensation for the old employees, who have dedicated their whole life to  develop the company, will be beneficial not only for the company but for the all employees in the company regardless of their age since the company can expect the loyalty and dedication from their employees which will lead to the advancement of the company.


Another reason that we can expect from the effort to maintain experienced old generation is that their accumulated experience is the most valuable resource which cannot be easily caculated in form of the money. Many companaies tend to regard intangible values such as experience and know-how which are mainly comming from old employees as negligible values, which might result in a huge loss to the company. For example, one of the biggest companies in Korea lay off many old employees to overcome the financial difficulty in the company. For several years later, they realized that the company actually have lost the main driving force which make the company competitive in the field as the most experienced people left the company because of the company's effort to reduce the cost of


In conclusion,
