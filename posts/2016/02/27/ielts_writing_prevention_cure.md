"Prevention is better than cure". Researching and treating diseses is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventative measures.

To what extend do you agree


There is much convincing evidence which demonstrates that investing in prevention of diseases can reap benefit for both society and the public fund. The rationale is that it is better and cheaper to prevent problems before they arise. However, curing diseases is necessarily, it require nevertheless much expense comparing with the cost of preventing the diseases. Because some of diseases cannot be preventable due to their inherent traits. Personally, I think we need to prioritize the preemtive methods while developing supplementing ways such as research and treatment for the diseases.


First of all, nobody cannot deny the fact that there are certain types of diseases, such as genetic disorder, which cannot be treated with preventable methods. In such case, the preventable measures are not really helpful to the patients who are already suffering from the genetic diseases. To help those patients, we have to put pressure on the government to more actively develop treating methods and invest more fund on the medical research fields involved in genetic diseases.


Secondly, there are many scientific evidences to prove that preventative measures are usually showing better performance in terms of cost effectiveness. Accordingly, we cannot help but agree that more resources should be allocated first in the fields to develop preventive medicines as it will be much more efficient ways to utilize our limited resources. In addition to this advantage, we might also save million people who could had been in serious medical status, if the preventive medicines have not been properly prepared.


In conclusion, it is quite evident that we need to find a solution to combine harmoniously those two methods above because it will yield the best outcome in the medical sector and the solution will benefit a myriad of patients regardless of their types of diseases.
