"Prevention is better than cure". Researching and treating diseses is too costly so it would be better to invest in preventative measures.

To what extend do you agree


There is much convincing evidence which demonstrates that investing in prevention of diseases can reap benefit for both society and the public fund. The rationale is that it is better and cheaper to prevent problems before they arise. However, curing diseases is necessarily, it require nevertheless much expense comparing with the cost of preventing the diseases. Because some of diseases cannot be preventable due to their inherent traits. Personally, I think we need to prioritize the preemtive methods while developing supplemanting ways such as research and treatment for the diseases.


First of all, nobody cannot deny the fact that there are certain type of diseases, such as genetic disorder, which cannot be preventable.
