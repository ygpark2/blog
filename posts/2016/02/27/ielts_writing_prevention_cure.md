When it comes to the subject of study, it is quite important to consider students' preference for the subjects since they might be able to exert their best performance on the subject they like.

The Purpose of Electives

elective courses give the opportunity to take classes outside of a prescribed plan of coursework.

In both college and high school, elective courses give students the chance to take classes outside of a prescribed plan of coursework. This lets students pursue other interests they may have, giving them a more "well-rounded" education. These electives also let students find subjects that might interest them and change the direction they wish to take with their education. A student who takes an elective class in drafting, for example, might discover a love of design and engineering that leads to a career he or she might not otherwise have found.
