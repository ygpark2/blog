To what extent do you agree or disagree?


As the competition for success is becomming more severe, people seem to pay more attention how to achieve success. In particular, parents, who want their children to be succeeded in a field, are really interested in the way how to raise their children successful. Some expert insist that a child's success is solely determined by thy way how the parent educate the children. However, I believe that there are more factors to influence child's the process of growth leading to the success except thy way the parent bring them up.


First of all, we are able to see many evidences that people, who was raised without their parents proper guidance, have made a successful career. For example, Barack Obama is a very representative case for this, since his parents are divorced at the time when he was very young age. His mother also cannot afford to take care of him adequately due to financial difficulty. That is the reason why he was sent to his grandmother and spent most of his childhood with their grandmother, which give hime a chance to learn many valuable lessons which became the cornerstone of becomming United States of America's president.


Secondly, an environment where a children was grown is also playing a vital role to determine his or her later life. There are many cases to prove that there is a strong correlation between the environment of an individual's success. For instance, one of my friends who are grown up in the rural area usually tend not to have a strong motivation to work harder, since they did understand that their efforts are not the only factor to influence a good harvest. There are other elements, such as rain, temperature and humidity, they need to consider to make a good outcome. Thus, people who are grown up in such environment are usually showing the attitude to take precedence to the environment which they cannot control.


In conclusion, it is quite hard to say that human's success is solely depending on the way how to educate them. Human's success seems to involve numerous factors such as willingness, determination and environment where they was grown. Therefore, people need to pay more attention to those factors to be deemed to influence to human's success.
