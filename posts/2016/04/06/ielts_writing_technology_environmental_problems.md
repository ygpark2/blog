Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.


Technological development has been unprecedented in human history for the past decades. Such changes have brought not only many benefits but also some drawbacks to human life. Some people insist that simple life style will contribute to lower many environmental problems whereas other people believe that the advanced technology might be an ideal solution for those problems. In this essay, I will deal with both views and leave my perspective on the debate.


On the one hand, there are a number of people who believe that the only way to unravel environmental problems is to convince people to adopt a simple lifestyle. This is because the key factor to exacerbate environmental problems is that people's complicated lifestyles constantly require people to consume too much products which will  eventually become trashes. As a result, people might end up with a situation in which they have to suffer due to the trash they generated from the excessive obsession to enjoy the convenience of the new technology.


On the other hand, many people rely on the idea that the new technology to lessen or resolve the severe environmental problems caused by the development of technology could be the ultimate solution. However, this idea could be precarious since the new technology people developed to solve the environmental problems can be the another source of environmental problems. For example, in Korea, air purifier is a quite popular item due to the increasingly deteriorated air pollution and thus it becomes an indispensable appliance on most households. But the abandoned purifier is becomming another problems to devastate our environment.


In conclusion, it is vital that people are aware of the gravity of environmental problems as they are inextricably interwined with people's lives. In the two different point of views, I would like to give precedence to the option to convince people to live a simple life which is the attitude to readily abandon the convenience of the technology as the technology solution might have side effects.
