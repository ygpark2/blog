Nowadays, the number of young criminals have been increasing in some countries, which lead to a big social concern to society as a whole. Some countries try to adopt social volunteer work for young criminals to achieve a better edificationanl goal whereas other countries still believe that punishment bring a best outcome in terms of education to make better behaviour. I believe that the disadvantages of imprisonment for young criminals outweigh the advantages.


First of all, we need to pay extra attention to the discrepency between adult and young criminals in terms of the mental maturity. The most of young criminals tend to commit a crime impulsively because they are lacking in judgement as well as control their impulse.  Thus if we do not properly consider their peculiarity, all the effort to make the young criminals for better people to be able to contribute to making our society more sound and safe will be more likely to be futile. Accordingly, compelling volunteer work for young criminals should be encouraged to curb the likelihood of being trapped in the vicious cycle of committing a crime again.


Secondly, another point that we need to concern is that a prison might play a role to share or develop the skills of crime to more advanced level. In particular, the sentence to send young criminals to the prison will be pernicious to them who are prone to be deceived by the attempt to convince them to join a such big violent or crime group in prison, which might bring a further disaster to our soceity with much more severe crime. Therefore, it is conducive not only to young criminals but to our society that young criminals should be forced to to volunteer work for our communities in stead of being sent to the prison.


In conclusion, it is safe to say that there is no benefit that we can expect by punishing young criminals with prison sentence. Furthermore, it seems to exacerbate the phenomenon to increase the number of repeate criminals as the prison play a role of school to share the information about crime or study together to find . Therefore, it is desirable to adopt a policy to compel young criminals to do some volunteer work for our society in lieu of spending their time in prison.
