Do you agree or disagree with this statement.



For years, a question many educators, parents, and researchers have been asking is whether or not it is academically beneficial to teach to boys and girls together or separately at school. Some argue that coeducation allows males and females of all ages to become more prepared for real-world situations, whereas a student that is only familiar with a single-sex setting could be less prepared, nervous, or uneasy. I am suspicious of the idea that coeducation can bring better outcomes in many educational aspects.


First of all, the argument that young students will lose the interest of opposite sex as they are in identical sex classes is not quite compelling because many students who were in the same sex classes tend to have stronger sexual desire against opposite sex. For example, I graduate from male high school. In male high school, it is quite common to find adult videos and megazines in the school, since they do not have any channel to access woman other than those unethical ways, which result in hampering their study.


Secondly, people who graduated from the single sex school are highly likely to experience a dfficulty in making a relationship with someone of the other gender because they could not have enough opportunities to know or experience the opposite sex in single sex classes.  It is known that a country with high rate of single school system tend to have a low rate of marriage and the problem of people having a difficulty to date with the opposite sex is increasingly becoming social concern to the society.


In conclusion, it is noteworthy that the disadvantes from the single sex school seem to outweigh the advantages we can expect from the one. Therefore, we should strive to seek to find a way to mitigate the worsening harmful effect from the single sex classes.
