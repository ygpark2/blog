Nobody cannot deny that traveling is becomming a big part of our lives because of the technology development combined with decreasing oil price. Naturally, this trend have brought several benefits to our society in addition to some drawbacks. I will dwell on those positive and negative aspects in this essay and leave my comment on that.


On the one hand, one of benefits we can expect from the increasing number of overseas traveller thanks to the cheaper air fare is that we can easily experience or meet a variety of ethnic group of people in my country, which is not a very common case several decades ago. For instance, when I was a middle school student, I could hardly find a chance to meet a foreigner in my town. Thus, the only channels that I can access foreign cultures and languages are books, movies and newspapers, which result in my impractical understanding about foreign cultures and languages. However such problem is withering into insignificance due to the increasing number of foreigners thanks to the cheaper air fare.


On the other hand, as many people worried about the safety of airplane, the likelihood of a airplane accident seems to increase at an alarming pace. Nowadays, there are numerous airlines to compete each other to lower the air fare which make the company more superior in a harsh competitive market. As we can frequently see the reports of airplane accidents on the newspapers, some of the companies are actually reluctant to invest money to strengthen the safety of airplane because of the severe competition among airlines. Hence, it is not very favorable to more safe air travel that the cheaper air fare was resulted in many airlines price competition.


In conclusion, the cheap air fare enable many people to travel abroad countries, which contribute to abolish many countral discrepancies and prejudice against foreigners. However, such low fare also undermine our safe air journey, which caused by severe price competition among airlines. Therefore, we need to come up with measures to curb the increased possibility of endangered air travel as the result of harsh price competition while maintainging the low price of air travel.
