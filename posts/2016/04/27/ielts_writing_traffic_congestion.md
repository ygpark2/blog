Nowadays, traffic congestion is becomming part of our life, since most of people tend to regard a vehicle as an essential commodity rather than a luxury item. Furthermore, as the income of family is sharply increasing thanks to economic development in my country, there are many people who can afford to buy a vehicle readily, which lead to exacerbating traffic congestion. I will deal with this issue in terms of the way how goverment and people are able to alleviate the problem.


First of all, the most urgent task that the goverment need to take care of is that it need to come up with a policy to levy a high tax rate to people who want to buy a second car.  As people's income is rising, there are many families who want to buy a second car, which is the main factor to cause the escalating problem of traffic congestion. I believe that it is the most effective method to curb the increasing number of cars as well as to lessen the traffic load on the road in terms of goverment.


Secondly, the easiest and simplest method to contribute to relieve the traffic congestion as an individual is to use public transfortation as many times as they can. Using public transfortation have a numerous of advantages. For example, they can enjoy reading books or chatting with their friends while they are in a bus. In addition to this, they can also freely use their mobile devices without conerning that distraction caused by cellphones might jeopardize other people's life when you drive.


In summary, it is evident that the goverment and a person need to work together to address the traffic jam as a result of the increasing number of cars. People's active using public transfortation and the goverment's policy to punish a family having more than one cars should be encouraged. If these combined works proceed, we are able to see the significant difference in traffic congestion.
