Discuss both sides and give your opinion


The belief that university degree will be a ticket to a better life is still prevailing in most advanced societies as the society is requiring more people who are having expert knowledge which can be abtained through the university education. On the contrary, there are still many people who believe that experience and soft skills which cannot be easily taught in university curriculum are vital to determine people's career. In this article, I will ananyze the both points of view and add my thoght.


On the one hand, nobody cannot deny the fact that there is a strong correlation between having a university degree and the likelihood of being employed. To elaboarte more, many people's deep-rooted prejudice that people with university degree are usually more capable of doing a job  is still rampant in our soceity. However, it is observable in many different fields that people who did not graduate or drop out a university have made huge success in their areas. For example, Bill Gates is a very representative case for this as he drop out of Harvard university and built one of the historical companies in IT field.


On the other hand, the argument that the effort to experience a variety of new things and develop soft skills should be valued more is deserved to draw more people's attention. People are designed to live or work together in their daily life. In such environment, the role of soft skills is becomming more important as you are constantly required to convince or pursuade people to acheive the target. In addition, you will be more likely to encounter many problems that you cannot resolve by solely relying on your knowledge. In that case, your experience become much more important, since it will give you a clue to solve the problems
