Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of expensive weddings.


Wedding is a momentous occasion in most cultures as most of people will marry someone at least once in a lifetime. Many people pull out all the stops and want to hold extravagant weddings to make unforgettable ceremonies. In this essay, I will dwell on the positive and negative aspects of expensive weddings.


On the one hand, there are numerous advantages that we can expect from the extravagant wedding ceremony. First of all, we are able to provide very expensive services, such as high quality meals and luxury presents, as a reward for attedning to our weddings, which may leave a good memory to people who participated our weddings. Secondly, couples who are supposed to marry do not need to pay much attention to preparing a wedding as they hired a company to do all the jobs for the wedding for the sake of them. Hence, those two reasons are the most important benefits we can expect from an expensive wedding.


On the other hand, the main drawback of expensive wedding is that there are many things that money cannot buy. For example, if a couple hire a wedding specialized company for their wedding ceremony, they will be highliy unlikely to enjoy the pleasure by making an effort together to make their ceremony memorable. In addition to this, if a couple believe that luxury presents and extravagant meals can do the job to appreciate the guests for their attending the ceremony, they might lose a valuable experience which they can obtain in the process of preparing the presents and meals by themselves instead of just purchasing those luxury items.


In summary, nobody cannot deny the fact that money is crucial to make a successful wedding ceremony. However if we put too much emphasis on the role of money to enjoy the extravagant wedding, we might be negligent of the values such as experience to prepare presents and meals, effort to make unique wedding ceremony. Thus, it should encourage people to build the wedding with their own power as it will make the wedding more meaningful to us.
