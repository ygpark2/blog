As the life expectancy is extended, the likelihood of having several job during people's lifetime is increasing. In particular, this trend is highly likely to be expanded, as time goes on. Thus, it is a meaningful attempt to speculate why people keep changing their careers and what kind of result have brought to our society.


First of all, the paramount reason of people constantly switching their job is that the jobs they had were disappearing because of technology advancement or industrial restructuring. It is said that a vast majority of people were compelled to leave the workplace or abandon their jobs since their skill and knowledge was regarded as an obsolete one. Thus, it is inevitable for people to change their job continuously in a rapidly developing society as new technology or innovation will easily make many people's jobs unnecessarily.


I am completely convinced that this phenomenon will help jeopardize many people's job security, which result in increasing people's stress and anxiety. In particular, the mental burden that people who have a family might feel will be aggravated as people will be more anxious if the the job security is guaranteed. In addition to this, old people who are not flexible enough to cope with such a rapidly changing society will be most likely to be victimized. Therefore, it is needed to develop social policies to protect these people from the mental pressure of forcing them to adapt new job.


In conclusion, we cannot be free from the social change to force us to adopt new jobs which we have never experienced before. It is evident that more people will feel this pressure to forcibly learn new technology and information to seek a new job. Therefore, we need to a variety of ways to better help people who are having a difficulty to change their careers.
