Discuss both views and give your opinion.


There are some people who believe that young people should be encouraged to travel as many foreign countries as they can. On the contrary, others argue that travelling might cause young people to waste their time and money. In person, I am in favor of the argument that travelling is of paramount importance to young people. Thus, I will deal with both points of view and leave my comment.


On the one hand, nobody cannot deny the fact that there are many people who have learned valuable life lessons, which you cannot readily obtain without overseas travel, such as understanding other culture, experiencing different lifestyle and respecing for ethnically different people, since it will lead you to a different environment where you have never experienced before. In addition to this, another benefit that people can expect through travel is that they can make many friends from different countries. People tend to be more open-minded, when they are in overseas countries. Such a mindset enable people to have more chance to make foreign friends.


On the other hand, there are many people who believe that young people should invest their time and energy to improve themselves in terms of academic achievement or saving money for their future rather than travelling. However, the experiences you had through travel at young age cannot be easily substituted with other values such as money and time. Furthermore, those experiences can contribute to make more money than you had before and a time more valuable. Thus, I want to insist that young people should not sacrifice the chance to travel overseas countries for saving money and time.


In conclusion, it is true that money and time is a crucial part of life. However, those things cannot be an excuse for not travelling abroad, since we can gain more benefits through overseas travel. Hence, I would like to encourage young people to take as many opportunities to travel abroad as they can.
