Many people take part in dangerous sports where people are regularly injured.
Most people accept that there are risks involved.
Some would like these dangerous sports to be prohibited.
Should dangerous sports be allowed or banned?



There are many extreme sports that people enjoy while taking a high risk of injury. Most people who participated in those sports are recognizing the danger involved in such activities. However, some people insist that these sports need to be regulated by a goverment to prevent people from endanger the risk of injury. Personally, I believe that we need to respect people's freedom to enjoy whatever they want to do on condition that people are fully aware of the degree of risk.


The first and foremore reason to let people enjoy whatever sports they want to do is that any intention or action to regulate people's freedom to choose whatever activity they want to do might be exploited as a purpose to restrict people's basic right which is freedom. In particular, any goverment's intervention on human actitivy have been strongly linked to the deterrence of human's freewill and right. Thus, we need to allow them to do whatever sports they want to do as long as they are fully aware of the consequence of the dangerous sports.


Another key point that we need to object the idea that these extreme sports should be regulated is that sometimes people need to enjoy such sports. As many people express their remarkable feeling such as conentration enhancement, alleviated stress and physical development after enjoying those sports, they certainly leave some benefits to human as well as danger. If we consider those benefits from the precarious sports, it is recommended that more people should take part in the dangerous exercise as long as preventative measures to minize the injury we may be able to receive from the sports is guaranteed.


In conclusion, the advantages we can expect from the dangerous sports seem to outweigh the drawback we might get. Thus the dangerous sports is not something baned but something we can enjoy and recommend to other people while makeing an effort to ensure the safety of the exercise.
