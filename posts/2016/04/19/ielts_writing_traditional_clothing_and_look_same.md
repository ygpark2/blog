Give the reasons for this. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?



Clothes have been essential elements of any human society from prehistoric times. A couple of decades ago, we could easily observer many people who were wearing traditional clothes on the street even on daily life. However, such picture is no longer observable at these days, since the mass production system in apparel have been prevailed for many years. I am convinced that such change is absolutely conducive to people overall and needed to be continued.


First of all, nobody cannot deny the fact that the Industrial Revolution have brought mass production to the industry of apparel, which result in significant price decreasing. Such low price for clothing based on mass production enable many people to readily buy clothes and have played a significant role to drive out the traditional clothes from the market. Basically traditional clothes are not suitable items for mass production, which make it less competitive in price competition. Thus, it is expected that the trend of disappearing of traditional clothes on the street, stores is inevitable as they are keep losing the competitiveness in the market.


On the one hand, thanks to the mass production, the clothes are becomming more identical than ever before. In order to reduce the cost of producing the clothes, they need to standardize the size, color and shape of clothes, which make it suitable for the mass production. Such effort to reduce the cost of the production of apparel have brought the result that most of people are wearing the almost same clothes on the streets. In addition to this, people's tendency to pursue the fashion trend seem to expedite this trend.


In conclusion, I believe that mass production is the main reason to make traditional clothing disappear from the people's selection list for clothes as well as contribute to strenthen the trend to encourage people to wear the standardized clothing. Therefore, it is a great pleasure for us to enjoy the abundance of clothes induced by mass production.
