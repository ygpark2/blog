Do you agree or disagree?


It goes without saying that advertisement has been playing a crucial role to build people's character. As the influence of advertisement is sharply increasing, more people seem to follow the trend established by advertisement, which lead to undermining individuality. However, I absolutely support the argument that advertisement is hugely contributing to the cirtumstance of losing people's unique character.


First of all, as the power of mass media companies is expanding, the number of people influenced by mass media companies are surging at an alarming pace. Accordingly, people seem to sacrifice their individualities in exchange for gaining the ideal image built by advertisements. For instance, many cosmetic companies spent a huge amount of money to employ beautiful celebrities in order to build the image that the customers will look like the celebrities as long as they keep purchasing their products, which result in neglecting paying more attention to themselves.


Secondly, another harmful effect of advertisement is that young people who have not fully developed their personality might fail to build their sound characters due to the constant exposure of advertisements. In particular, it has been proven that young people are known for being very susceptible to the other people's opinions or thoughts which are largely affected by the advertisements. Thus, it is very critical to minimize the power of influence of the advertisements to protect our children from the failure to build their own personalities.


In conclusion, nobody can be free from the influence of advertisements in our modern society. Therefore, what we have to do in order to eradicate the known detrimental factors of advertisements in developing individuality is that we need to carefully observe the influence of advertising to establishing human personality.

more people seem to put priority on the image established by the advertisements rather than the image they build.
