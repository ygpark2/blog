Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.


Museums are quite important facilities to human life in many aspects. Especially, for the purpose of education of young children, it has been playing a crucial role in our society. In order to maximize the benefits of such facilities, it is important question as to whether the museum should be operating on a charge basis or not. Personally, I stick to the thought that the cost of running museum should be compensated by the public fund, which lead to the free service of museum.


The one of evident benefits we can expect from the free charge of museum is that it will provide a chance to enjoy the museum  to people which cannot afford to pay the fee for the admission. It goes without saying that it will contribute to narrow down the gap between rich and poor people in terms of education opportunities. For example, when I traveled Philippine, I had a chance to visit a museum. The museum charge a small fee for the entrance which is not a big money to me but local people felt that the fee is almost half of their daily income, which deprive the people of the chance to learn and experience their museum because of the fee.


On the other hand, there are many drawbacks in museum running on the basis of charge. Firstly, charging fee for admission in a museum could play a role of a barrier to block people having a willingness to learn something from the museum but no money for the admission. Additionally, it is shameful to discourage people to participate in learning activities in museum due to the fee. Secondly, if the charge of the service of a museum is justified, the museum is hardly becoming a place open to most of people regardless of their financial status, which might contribute to build an awareness that the museum is a closed facility and a enjoyable place for rich.


To sum up, it seems evident that the drawbacks of admission fee for the museum exceed the advantages. Therefore, as more people freely enjoy the museum without admission fee, the museum will become a place loved by many people, which lead to the improvement of the quality of people's lives.
