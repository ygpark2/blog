The rapid surge of obesity in children have been a prevailed problem in many advanced countries. Those countries are making an effort to come up with countermeasures to address the issue. In this essay, I will deal with the way to guide children to maintaining their health more sound.


First of all, it is conceived that children's reckless eating habits are largely attributed to unhealthy diet. In particular, the instant food is an important factor to make the situation worse. For example, one of my friends who have enjoyed hamburgers from very young age is having an extreme difficulty due to obesity. His several attempts to stop eating instant food have failed, since his habit have been constructed for many years, which make him difficult to alter his habit. Thus parents need to teach and educate their children to build healthier eating habit, which will certainly lead to the curb the rise of obesity population.


Secondly, we need to raise awareness of the consequence of obesity from young children. Children often do not seem to fully comprehend the severity of the disease of obesity, as they are tending to neglect the outcome of their action. From another perspective, children could be an ideal candidate to raise awareness of the severity of obesity because they are more free from the habitual eating for instant food. Hence, it is more effective to try to increase the awareness of the severity of obesity to young children rather than adults.


In conclusion, it goes without saying that there are a number of ways to improve the worsning trend of children's obesity other than those two ways that I suggested. The most important thing is that we need to take an action as soon as possible to protect our next generation from suffering the epidemic obesity.
