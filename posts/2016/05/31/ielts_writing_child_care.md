Discuss both views and give your own opinion.


It is quite controversial that childcare facilities will be the best place for children to be well taken care of, since other people believe that family members should be in charge of raising kids. In this essay, I will examine the two condradicting views and add my thought on the subject.


To begin with, it is no doubt that child-care facilities are more competent in comparison of child's relatives in terms of taking care of children. This is because people who are working in the child-care centers are required to be trained and educated in a university or special education centers for childcare, which ehnace their speciality in childcare. In addition to this, most of child-care facilities are well designed and specialized to serve the purpose of nurturing kids, which is believed to be lacking in family home.


On the other hand, the most evident advantage we can gain from relatives involvement of nurturing children is that they can take care of kids with affection and interest. However, it is hard to find such strong affection and interest in child-care centers as people in the centers usually do not have any emotional connection with the kids they are raising. Another benefit from raising kids with the help of family members is that we can nurture children in the most comfortable environment, which is abosultely conducive to ensure a sense of security.


To sum up, the two differen point of views with regard to raising kids by family members or child-care centers seem to have their own advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, raising kids with family members seems to provide the best environment for the kids in various aspects.
