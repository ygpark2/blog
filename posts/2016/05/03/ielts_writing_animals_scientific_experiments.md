Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using anmals in scientific experiments.



Animal experiments are widely used to develop new medicines and to test the safety of other products. Many of these experiments cause pain to the animals involved or reduce their quality of life in other way. Thus, I vehemently oppose the idea that scientific experiments for animal should be encouraged and continued for the sake of the welfare of the human being.


First of all, diseases that are artificially induced in animals in a laboratory, whether they be mice or monkeys, are never identical to those that occur naturally in human beings. Especially, animal species differ from one another biologically in many siginificant ways, it becomes even more unlikely that animal experiments will yield results that will be correctly interpreted and applied to the human condition in a meaningful way.


Secondly, reliance on animal experiments can be detrimental in other areas of medical research. When scientists disregard human clinical findings in favor of animal test results, the consequences can be devastating. An important example is the harmful effects of smoking. The discovery that smoking causes lung cancer was achieved through studies of human populations. Yet, unsuccessful attempts to induce lung cancer in laboratory animals by forcing them to breathe tobacco smoke cast doubt on the human studies and delayed health warnings for years, costing thousands of lives.


In conclusion, the idea that lives can be saved by sacrificing animals must be rejected. We need a new generation of scientists who no longer regard animals as the disposable tools of research.
