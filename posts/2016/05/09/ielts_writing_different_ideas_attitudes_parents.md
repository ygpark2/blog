Conflicts between generations is as old as parents and teenagers. All of us remember fussing at our parents with the common angst filled with complaint. Today, more than ever before, a lack of intergenerational understanding has spilled into everywhere. It shows up in a variety of ways, and at some very important, and sometimes unexpected moments. In this essay, I deal with the differences between generations in terms of ideas and attitudes and the reasons why it is persistent in every society.





The generation gap with regard to ideas and attitudes between the parents and the young is due to the fact that the parents have experienced real life and whatever they have learned from personal experience had become a true knowledge for them. However, young people who do not have enough time to build those experiences naturally will be more susceptible to other people's opinion or thought. Suppose they have tried to beomce an actor and failed, they might have concluded that it is not possible to become an actor in the film industry. They will be more likely to advice their children not to commit the same mistake again, which will be likely to influence their children's decision for their future career as they are easily

Thus, the parents tend to regard their personal experiences as universal knowledge, which could be wrong
