Conflicts between generations is as old as parents and teenagers. All of us remember fussing at our parents with the common angst filled with complaint. Today, more than ever before, a lack of intergenerational understanding has spilled into everywhere. It shows up in a variety of ways, and at some very important, and sometimes unexpected moments. In this essay, I deal with the differences between generations in terms of ideas and attitudes and the reasons why it is persistent in every society.


Advancement in technology has lead to the generation gap in this modern world. Children tend to spend most of their time with their digital devices and busy with social media that they do not discuss their problems with their parents. The internet provides solutions to most of the worldly problems that children instead of contacting their own parents use the help of the internet in case of any problem, thus again reducing the communication and leading to a generation gap between them.


The generation gap with regard to ideas and attitudes between the parents and the young is due to the fact that the parents have experienced real life and whatever they have learned from personal experience had become a true knowledge for them. However, young people who do not have enough time to build those experiences naturally will be more susceptible to other people's opinion or thought. Suppose they have tried to become an actor and failed, they might have concluded that it is not possible to become an actor in the film industry. They will be more likely to advice their children not to commit the same mistake again, which will be likely to influence their children's decision for their future career as they are easily


One factor that has heavily influenced generation gaps is the accelerating rate of change in society. In the past, developments in society were slow. As a result, two or three generations lived lifestyles that were very similar to each other. There were not many differences across generations. However, given technological and social advances that have taken place in the 20th and 21st centuries, the lifestyles of individuals even one generation apart are drastically different from each other.


In conclusion, I think the generation gap has been greatly increased these days because the time is changing fast and people find it difficult to cope up with this change. Therefore, to overcome this problem parent must be close to their children.
