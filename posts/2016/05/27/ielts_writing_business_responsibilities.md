To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?


There is no denying that business have been large part of human activity. As the influence of business is increasing, people start to contemplate and require the social responsibility of a business. In my opinion, it is absurd argument that a business is completely free from the social responsibility because it is the organization for the purpose of pursuing profit.


To begin with, any human activities including business should take a certain amount of social responsibility because they are inextricably interwined with other people's lives. For instance, if a factory release contaminated water into river without taking proper measure to purify the water, it might lead to jeopardizing other people's lives. Considering the nature of business which prioritize the profit, it seems quite natural for the owner of the business to take an action to minimize the cost, which serve well the purpose of the business while hampering the quality of other people's lives.


Secondly, most of business which is reluctant to fulfill their social responsibility seems to end up with the failure of the business because it will lose the customers' trust. For example, the most prestigious company in my country did not faithfully conduct the rules to protect its employees from the hazardous material, which cause many employees' lives. As a result, they cannot help but lose very large portion of market share due to the incident which lead to campaign against , which might result in the bankruptcy of the business.


In conclusion, it is necessarily not only for the success of a business but the community we live that any businesses pursuing profit should abide by the principles to serve social responsibilities. Therefore, we need to encourage businesses people to participate this movement to make our societies a better place by asking them to respect social responsibilities.
