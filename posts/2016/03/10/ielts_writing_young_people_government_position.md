Some argue younger people are not suitable for important positions in the government, while others think this is a good idea.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.


Some people insist that it is quite doubtful that younger people are able to conduct the role of high positions in the government whereas other people believe that it will be conducive to the government to place high positions upon younger people. In this essay, I will discuss both views and add my thought on them.


On the one hand, the main opposition of the idea that young people are eligible to the crucial positions in government is because young people is known to have relatively short experience compared to old people. Such argument is basically based on the belief that the high positions in government require an accumulated experience to perform the role properly. However, some of the high positions in government is requiring very in depth knowledge about a specific field, which can be obtained through special course to train people for the purpose to fulfill the professional role . Thus, some of high positions need to be filled with a person who have a special knowledge with regard to the field regardless of age.


On the other hand, some people believe that young people are entitled to perform high positions in government. But it could be a precarious idea if we do not consider their speciality and the requirements of the positions. For example, some of the high positions do not solely rely on the speicial knowledge. They are in fact requiring a comprehensive examination of a situation which can be developed through a myriad of experiences. Thus, such positions can hardly be free from the person's age as those experiences, which is conducive to developing the ability of a comprehensive judgement, cannot be achieved within short period of time.


In conclusion, we need to be smart to find an appropriate candidate for the high position. If we only consider their age for the position in government, it could be not only harmful to the government but undesirable for the person to conduct the role of high position. Therefore, we should not stop making an effort to find a person who are able to meet the requirements of the high positions, being cautious of only considering age.
