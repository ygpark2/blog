Studying humanities subjects (literature, history, philosophy) in university have little value for career

To what extend do you agree/disagree


Most people are convinced that majoring humanities subjects in university will not be very conducive tho hir or her future career. In particular, as society is becoming more technologically advanced, there is a high demand for engineers. However, I still believe that humanities subjects are the ones that we cannot easily ignore or neglect since those subjects will provide many meaningful advantages over other candidate in the competition of employment.


First of all, it goes without saying that humanities subjects have been the foundation of many other subjects such as science, engineering and mass media, which means that studying humanities subjects will be necessarily to increase the chance of the your job opportunities in the areas of science, engineering and media companies. For example, a person who have a deep knowledge about philosophy be highly likely to show better performance in the practical subjects where most job opportunities reside in, since the humanities subjects are strong basis for the practical subjects.


Secondly, with rapidly developing technology, people seem to pay more attention to the humanitarian issues as they feel that they are isolated from the world. As such trend is reinforced, the need or effort to find an answer about philosophical questions will be prevailed in contemporary society. Naturally, it will create more job opportunities in the humanitarian areas which have been previously not very popular to people. In addition to this, expert groups predict that humanities subjects are very promising field in the near future as people's need in this area will sharply increase.


In conclusion, I absolutely disagree with the idea that humanities degree will have little impact on securing job. As I mentioned above two reasons to support the argument that it is still worthwhile to study the subjects which was regarded as useless majors to obtain job,  it is absolutely promising in terms of career development to study humanities subjects.
