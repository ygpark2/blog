Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (e.g. words, pictures, music and films).  However, some people think that the government should implement some restrictions to govern creative artists.

To what extent do you agree with these views?



Historically, it is proven fact that the freedom of expression is the most influential factor to the prosperity of art.  There are still many areas where the freedom of expression is jeopardized, which result in the shrinking of many artists' activities. However, the argument that the government intervention is necessary in the artists' activities is still gaining power among some people. In my opinion, I absolutely agree with the idea that the government intervention in activities to express people's ideas unnecessary evil.


First of all, the foremost reason of a government intervention in people's activities is that it want to regulate or prohibit the activities unfavorable to the government. Furthermore, any government's attempts to intervene people's activities to express their feelings or thoughts will discourage people's morale to represent themselves, which will lead to undermining the freedom of expression. There are also many historical evidences to prove that the government intervention to human activities have been always failed. Thus, the government should minimize its regulation on human's artistic activities and try to find ways to encourage people to freely express.


Secondly, government's hostile attitude toward human's expression will certainly rein in the development of human creativity as the creative thoughts tend to be more advanced in the environment of freely expressing themselves. Obviously, the communist countries's relatively slow development compared to democratic countries largely attributed to their constant investigation for the human activities and their effort to suppress people's the freedom of expression. Hence, as it is proved that the development of human creativity is closely related with the government's intention to oppress people's expression, we need to establish a governmental system ensuring the freedom of expression.


In conclusion, as I pointed out above, the government's any action to oppress human's expression is certainly detrimental to the activities of creative artists. Therefore, I vehemently oppose the idea that the government should restrict creative people's artistic activities.
