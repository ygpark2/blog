What are the reasons for this problem?
What action can be taken to address this problem?


It is abundantly evident that people are losing consideration for other people and their lack of understanding other people frequently cause many social conflicts in society. In this essay, I will analyze the reasons for the issue and devise possible measures to tackle this social phenomenon.


First of all, I believe that such negative social trend is mainly attributed to nuclear family with one or two children since people who have been grown up in nuclear family have a strong tendency to show selfishness in social relationship. A recent study about the correlation between people's social behaviour and the size of family also support the argument. More specifically, the study proved that children who have been receiving too much care and attention from parent and relatives in nuclear family apt to show worse performance in comprehending other people's emotion and situation. Thus it will lead to many social problems.


The possible solution for such trend is that society as a whole need to raise awareness about the rapid surge in anti-social and careless behaviour. Many people do not seem to fully comprehend the seriousness of the social problems caused by people's reckless behaviour. Taking advantage of the media will be the most effective way in boosting people's recognition with regard to the issue as most of people are constantly exposed to the many different types of the media almost every day. Thus, the idea to introduce the media as a medium to deliver the exact situation of people's lack of consideration for other people can be regarded as a briliant countermeasure for the problems.


In conclusion, as nuclear families are becomming more common and the number of children who are raised in the nuclear family are increasing, it is inevitable to encounter those social problems. Therefore, we need to capitalize on the media to raise awareness about the aggravating problems caused by people lacking of due respect for the others, which might lead to a bigger social concern.
