How true is this statement?
What are the important qualities that a journalists should have.


Nobody cannot deny the fact that the influence of media in our daily lives has been unprecedented over the past several decades. Such trend is becomming aggravated thanks to the advancement of technology such as mobile devices, the Internet and cable TV channels. In this circumstance, the question about how to ensure the credibility of journalists is gaining importance as we are heavily relying on the media as a tool to obtain information and knowledge.


On the one hand, people seem to start to suspect the truthfulness of the information from the news because there are many players to influence media companeis to manipulate the information to serve their needs. For instance, Samsung is one of the biggest sponsor to media companeis as they spend a huge amount of money for advertisement of its products. some of media companeis report about Samsung's inhumane treatment of employee. As a result of the report, the media company have to suffer financial difficulty for a long time since Samsung did not provide any advertising deals to the company in retaliation to the news to reveal the dark side of Samsung.


Automatically, the ways how to enhance journalists' ethical standard are gaining more attention from the public as more people believe that these methods will contribute immensely to the improvement of the credibility of the information in the news. I believe that the most critical factor that journalists are expected to have is courage in turbulent times since they will be bombarded with unlimited pressure to alter or conceal the truth from many other powerful authorities and companeis. With lack of courage to resist those pressures, it will be extremely difficult to maintain his or her role as journalists who are abide by their ethical criteria.


In conclusion, people who are benefiting from the news or information produced by many journalists also need to help them achieve their goal to be free from the pressure from other influential people or companies. In addition to this, goverment also need to take this issue seriously and come up with a countermeasure to tackle the problem to jeopardize the effort of journalists to produce truthful information and news.
