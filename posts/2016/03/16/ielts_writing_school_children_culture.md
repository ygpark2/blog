It is more important for school children to learn about their local culture than other cultures in the world.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.


Over the past decades, the issue as to whether school should teach children about local culture in stead of other country's culture is becomming more crucial in society. As the globalization is expedited, the gravity of education about other cultures is drawing more attention among people. In this article, I argue that studying both local culture and other cultures is necessarily to raise kids who  are highly likely to live with other people with totally different cultural background in globalized society.


First of all, mastering local culture is definately conducive to build people's identity as local culture is the accumulation of the local people's living style, tradition and custom. For example, my elementary school friend who emigrate to New Zealand at his early age, which result in not having enough chances to learn the local culture. Recently, I met him in my hometown. He shared his experience as to why the education of local culture is vital to people, since he was struggled to adjust himself to the new education system in New Zealand mainly due to his weak identity which he could not afford to develop because of his early immigration.


On the other hand, we can frequently encounter the news about conflicts caused by lack of understanding of other cultures in the media. In particular, people will be more likely to live in the ehnically diverse society. Accordingly, the gravity of comprehending other cultures have been unprecedented and the government also need to be aware of the potential issues caused by lack of mutual understanding about their cultural background. Hence it is also necessary to incorporate the values of other cultures, as people might have to live in the society where many different people having diverse cultural background live.


In conclusion, it is not wise choice to emphasize only one factor between local culture and other cultures as our children will be most likely to live in the ethnically diverse society. Therefore, the education of putting emphasis on both factors will be the most beneficial selection for out future generation.
