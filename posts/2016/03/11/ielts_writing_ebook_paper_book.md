With the rise of e-books comes the decline in paper books. Some people see this as a good step forward while others do not.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?



The emergence of e-books have many implications in the book publishing industry. The noticeable evident trend could be found in the paper books which have kept declining since e-book have been introduced in the market. Some people believe that this is a meaningful development to put the book industry in advanced level while other people see this technological progress as a tool to hamper people's experience and understanding for book.


On the one hand, the biggest advantage of the e-book is that it will immensely reduce the amount of paper to produce books. As the global warming issue is becoming more severe, the introduction of e-book will make tremendous difference to the such effort to resolve the exacerbating climate problem. For example, we can curtail the number of trees to make a paper by using more e-books, which result in lessening the degree of seriousness of global warming.


On the other hand, one of the drawbacks in capitalizing on e-books is that it will disrupt our experience with paper books such as feeling, smell and short note we can leave on the book. We are not only obtaining the information in a book but also feeling, smelling and noting a book, while e-book are only focused on transferring the content of the book to the readers. When we remind the book we read, nobody cannot deny the fact that feeling, smelling and short note will play a vital role to remind the story of the book.


In conclusion, we have reviewed the advantage and disadvantage of the trend caused by the emergence of the e-book. We can benefit from the introduction e-book. However, we also need to sacrifice some values, which we take them for granted in paper book, in e-book. Therefore, I hope that people find a way to balance between bad and good perspective of e-book.
