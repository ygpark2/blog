        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/11/02/ielts_writing_peer_pressure/">What can parents do to make sure that their children do not give in to peer pressure?</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Q. Teenagers are highly influenced by their friends. There is a term called 'peer pressure' meaning that a child is forced to behave in a manner that is acceptable to his/her friends. These behaviors may range from simple dress codes to drinking and smoking. What can parents do to make sure that their children do not give in to peer pressure? Explain and/or give examples of situations.</p><p id='p-2'>Teenagers are very susceptible to the opinions or thoughts of their friends. They are very cautious and sensitive in expressing themselves since they constantly pay much attention to their friends’ judgement or reaction with regard to their behaviors. In this essay, I will explain what parents are able to make their kids be free from the influence from their peer.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, I believe the first thing parents have to do to provide a good advise for the difficulty 'peer pressures' their kids are encountering in their school is that they have to bolster their children’s confidence and self esteem. There are several researches to prove that people who are less influenced by their friends usually have a tendency to have a strong confidence and self esteem. For instance, when I was middle school student, I had a very low self esteem. My main decison criteria was always what my friends think and feel since I felt that my friends’ judgement seems to be superior to mine. Therefore, I always have to behave the way to make my friends happy.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, parents need to teach their kids that there is no way to please all people around them. Teenagers usually want to make a good relationship with any friends. In doing so, they have to keep considering their friends’ need and expectation. For example, when I realized that I cannot satisfy all my friends’ expectation and furthermore sometimes it require my sacrifice which certainly make me unhappy. Therefore I can be much more free after I dicide to abandon some of my friends’ judgements or thoughts.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, it is quite meaningful for teenagers to realize what behaviors or thoughts can be acceptable to their peer. However parents also need to make an effort to teach their kids how to mingle with their friends without too much considering their friends’ expectation.</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/11/01/ielts_writing_interaction_technology/">Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Q. Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?</p><p id='p-2'>There is no denying that technology has been an indispensible element in our communication tools. As technology is becomeing more advanced, it has brought a significant change in the way people make a relationships. In this essay, I want to examine what impact it has brought.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, the appearance of smart phone has brought a tremendous change in the way of people’s communication. Especially the programs such as Skype, Facebook and Twitter allow people to give many opportunities to meet your acquaintances, who you have known once, easily using the mechanism of following and follwer. For example, I have made a connection with a person who I knew in my workplace in Facebook. Accidently I came across his firends list on his Facebook and luckily I could find one my old friends who graduated at the same elementary school. Thanks to Facebook, I could meet again with my beloved friend and know other firends news as well through him.</p><p id='p-4'>On the other hand, we tend to rely heavily on the convenience of such technology, which will, I believe, lead to make the relationship vunerable since there is no consistent relationship without a constant effort to sustain the relationship. For instance, I have made several friends, when I travel abroad countries and I collected their email and Skype account since I believe that I can continuously maintain the relationship utilizing the technology. However, the convenience does not give a motivation to me. Furthermore, the belief that I can connect with them through the technology make me neglect endeavor to communicate with them, which naturally result in losing the friends.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, the relationship we are making using technology can be beneficially as long as we are carefully using the advantages of technology. However we should also be cautious in adopting the technology for the purpose of making relationships since it might bring some undesirable result.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?</p><p id='p-2'>Many countries have struggled to tackle the issue caused by high health care cost for the people who are suffering due to obesity. In this essay I will analyse the causes about why this trend is worsening and what measures we can take to alleviate or eradicate the problems of deteriorated people’s health.</p><p id='p-3'>The foremost reason for obesity is food. Especially, instant food is regarded as the main causes to aggravate the health of people. Owing to the convenience and the relatively cheap price of the instant food, people is inclined to eat quite frequently , which result in obesity related disease. Another reason might be the intake of too much sugar. A recent report analysing the amount of sugar people consume daily said that the level of people’s consumption is dangerous and suggested that the public health authority need to take prompt action to curb the trend otherwise the society will have to pay a tremendous amount of cost to manage diabetes.</p><p id='p-4'>One of the measures I can think of to deter the worsening health issue among people is to raise awareness of the severe consequence of failing to manage their health due to their reckless eating habit. Additionaly, building many fitness centers which are adjacent to people’s resident area will naturally lead to increase the likelihood of exercise. These methods will bring some meaningful change to the current tendency to improve the continously increasing the average weight of people.</p><p id='p-5'>In summary, the reasons that I mentioned above are needed to be taken into further consideration to improve the problems of aggravating health and suggested measures should be implemented without hesitation to achieve the goal of maintaing people’s sound body.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?</p><p id='p-2'>Global warming and traffic jam, we are facing in our daily life, has received notable attention from many countries, which is believed to be caused by the sharply increasing the number of car on roads. Many people believe the price level of petrol is very cheap, which it stimulate people to buy more car. However I do not believe the petrol price is the only reason to aggravate the problems. I will examine what other measures can be considered to prevent the escalating pollution and traffic jam.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, no one can deny that there is a close correlation between the price level of petrol and the escalating traffic jam and worsening pollution. However, it is quite naive belief that we are able to curb the number of cars and the pollution by solely controlling the price of petrol. Some of the people who are rich enough do not really care the price of petrol. Therefore I cannot trust such belief the price level of petrol will decisively determine the impact of traffic and pollution issues.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, the other measures to tackle those issues except setting the price of petrol are to levy a high tax on the buyer of the cars and to apply high tax rate to petrol. The money collected from the buyer under the name of tax should be invested to build new roads to lessen the traffic jam and to eliminate the bottleneck. In addition to this, the company to develop the equipment to clean the polluted air should be given incentives in terms of funding for research and development. Thus these methods will contribute significantly to contain the</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, as I examine the limited impact of price control for petrol against traffic and polution problems, we cannot solve the issues by only relying on the high price of petrol. Therefore we have to find a combined strategy to tackle the problems effectively and enhance the quality of human life.</p>
