        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/11/01/ielts_writing_interaction_technology/">Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology.</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Q. Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?</p><p id='p-2'>There is no denying that technology has been an indispensible element in our communication tools. As technology is becomeing more advanced, it has brought a significant change in the way people make a relationships. In this essay, I want to examine what impact it has brought.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, the appearance of smart phone has brought a tremendous change in the way of people’s communication. Especially the programs such as Skype, Facebook and Twitter allow people to give many opportunities to meet your acquaintances, who you have known once, easily using the mechanism of following and follwer. For example, I have made a connection with a person who I knew in my workplace in Facebook. Accidently I came across his firends list on his Facebook and luckily I could find one my old friends who graduated at the same elementary school. Thanks to Facebook, I could meet again with my beloved friend and know other firends news as well through him.</p><p id='p-4'>On the other hand, we tend to rely heavily on the convenience of such technology, which will, I believe, lead to make the relationship vunerable since there is no consistent relationship without a constant effort to sustain the relationship. For instance, I have made several friends, when I travel abroad countries and I collected their email and Skype account since I believe that I can continuously maintain the relationship utilizing the technology. However, the convenience does not give a motivation to me. Furthermore, the belief that I can connect with them through the technology make me neglect endeavor to communicate with them, which naturally result in losing the friends.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, the relationship we are making using technology can be beneficially as long as we are carefully using the advantages of technology. However we should also be cautious in adopting the technology for the purpose of making relationships since it might bring some undesirable result.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. In some countries the average weight of people is increasing and their levels of health and fitness are decreasing. What do you think are the causes of these problems and what measures could be taken to solve them?</p><p id='p-2'>Many countries have struggled to tackle the issue caused by high health care cost for the people who are suffering due to obesity. In this essay I will analyse the causes about why this trend is worsening and what measures we can take to alleviate or eradicate the problems of deteriorated people’s health.</p><p id='p-3'>The foremost reason for obesity is food. Especially, instant food is regarded as the main causes to aggravate the health of people. Owing to the convenience and the relatively cheap price of the instant food, people is inclined to eat quite frequently , which result in obesity related disease. Another reason might be the intake of too much sugar. A recent report analysing the amount of sugar people consume daily said that the level of people’s consumption is dangerous and suggested that the public health authority need to take prompt action to curb the trend otherwise the society will have to pay a tremendous amount of cost to manage diabetes.</p><p id='p-4'>One of the measures I can think of to deter the worsening health issue among people is to raise awareness of the severe consequence of failing to manage their health due to their reckless eating habit. Additionaly, building many fitness centers which are adjacent to people’s resident area will naturally lead to increase the likelihood of exercise. These methods will bring some meaningful change to the current tendency to improve the continously increasing the average weight of people.</p><p id='p-5'>In summary, the reasons that I mentioned above are needed to be taken into further consideration to improve the problems of aggravating health and suggested measures should be implemented without hesitation to achieve the goal of maintaing people’s sound body.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?</p><p id='p-2'>Global warming and traffic jam, we are facing in our daily life, has received notable attention from many countries, which is believed to be caused by the sharply increasing the number of car on roads. Many people believe the price level of petrol is very cheap, which it stimulate people to buy more car. However I do not believe the petrol price is the only reason to aggravate the problems. I will examine what other measures can be considered to prevent the escalating pollution and traffic jam.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, no one can deny that there is a close correlation between the price level of petrol and the escalating traffic jam and worsening pollution. However, it is quite naive belief that we are able to curb the number of cars and the pollution by solely controlling the price of petrol. Some of the people who are rich enough do not really care the price of petrol. Therefore I cannot trust such belief the price level of petrol will decisively determine the impact of traffic and pollution issues.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, the other measures to tackle those issues except setting the price of petrol are to levy a high tax on the buyer of the cars and to apply high tax rate to petrol. The money collected from the buyer under the name of tax should be invested to build new roads to lessen the traffic jam and to eliminate the bottleneck. In addition to this, the company to develop the equipment to clean the polluted air should be given incentives in terms of funding for research and development. Thus these methods will contribute significantly to contain the</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, as I examine the limited impact of price control for petrol against traffic and polution problems, we cannot solve the issues by only relying on the high price of petrol. Therefore we have to find a combined strategy to tackle the problems effectively and enhance the quality of human life.</p>

            <h2 id='p-1'>Many people believe that social networking sites ( such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extend do you agree?</h2><p id='p-2'>The vast majority of people are convinced that the increasing number of social networking sites seems to have side effect on people as well as society in terms of a variety of aspect. However, there are a few people still believe that the online networking application have encourage people to meet a new person and facilitated the connection between people. My argument about this issue is that we need to maximize the benefits such sites can bring about and minimize the negative effects they might incur.</p><p id='p-3'>The first good point we can obtain in using those sites is that they actually make it easier to meet an unknown person. To elaborate more, as the society is more specialized, people are experiencing meeting new people within their speciality boundary. For example we have to spend most of our time in our workplace, it is quite hard to imagine that we ᅟare highly like to meet new people who are totally unrelated with our job. Thus, at these days, the sites are the only channel we can utilize to broaden our social relationship.</p><p id='p-4'>Another positive aspect of harnessing those sites is that especially the society which is suffering due to low birth rate might be able to overcome the issue easily through those sites. For instance, as more people take advantage ot the sites, the number of marriage couple will naturally increase thanks to the sites, which will eventually lead to the high birth rate. Therefore the society need to make an effort to raise an awareness of those sites and encourage them to use more frequently.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, we can conclude that the social networking sites seems to be beneficially not only to our society but also to individuals</p>

I believe such volunteers have been educated about how important their works are and experienced how much pleasure they will receive in return for their work. Thus I totally agree with the idea to include the social service program to high school curriculum.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, we need to dwell on the several benefits from enforcing the course to ask the high school students to do social service without any financial compensation. The first thing they can obtain from the compelling social course is that they can fully enjoy the happyness money cannot give. For instance, one of my friends who had a strong idea to</p>
