            <p id='p-1'>Q. Every year several languages die out. Some people think that this is not important because life will be easier if there are fewer languages in the world. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?</p><p id='p-2'>At these days, some people believe that the pace of the disappearance of languages is quite alarming whereas other people is convinced that the matter is not worrisome issue since they believe there is some benefit we can expect from the phenomenon such as less burden to learn the decreased number of languages. However I personally believe that it is quite rediculous idea that we should welcome the circumstance of disappearing languages because we will be less stressful from the learning of languages.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, the biggest problem we encounter from the languages disappearance is that we are losing the medium to understand other ethnic group’ culture and tradition. Most of civilization leave their the most precious knowledge and experience in the form of character. If we failed to preserve their own languages, there is no other way to obtain their the most valuable cultural heritage. There are many cases, that we cannot interpreset ancestor’s monuments since we do not have the ancestor’s language, in our history as well.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, it is common sense that language is quite closely related with the identity of people. Usually we can distinguish ourselves with other people in terms of the languages we or they speak. For instance, the first thing Japanese goverment did under Japanese rule in Korea is to eradicate our language because they believed that the first step to destroy our tradition and identity should be started on forcing them to use Japanese language. But we tenaciously resisted their unreasonable rule so that we can finally preserve our identity as well as language, which lead to the independence of the colony.</p><p id='p-5'>To sum up, as suggested above, language disappearance seems to have more negative impact on people than the benefits we can expect. Therefore, we should zero in on how to preserve and inherit our prolific languages to our next generation to come.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</p><p id='p-2'>Enhancing public health has been main concern for many countries which are struggling to find a better way to improve people’s health. Some people believe that the increasing number of sports complexes have hugely contributed to make people more healthy whereas other people believe that we have to come up with a variety of ways to improve people’s health.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, there is no denying that the effort to construct more facilities where people is able to exercise easily and freely have significanly affected on the improvement of public health. However the effort sometimes turn out to be futile owing to the lack of the information with regard to how to use the facilities and the promotion of people’s awareness. Thus I am strongly convinced that we have to make an effort to build many sports complexes as well as develop many methods to distribute the information effectively.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, it is believed by some that such way to build many sports facilities is not sufficent enough to make a substantial impact on the enhancement of public health, thus we have to find other ways to contribute to the improvement of public health. A very representative other measure is to subsidize the expense of using the commercial sports facilities so that people feel less burden to utilize those facilities. Obvioulsy, this way will be conducive to the people who are reluctant to pay the money for sports facilities, which will lead to attract more people to the facilities. Hence it is very important to know how people feel about the idea that we devised to make the plan more effective.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, we have reviewed several methods in addition to the building of more sports complexes. From this review, we can reach the conclusion that the sole plan to expand sports facilities will not bring any significant change to the improvement of public health. Therefore it is meaningful to consider other measures as well to see improvement on public health.</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/11/02/ielts_writing_peer_pressure/">What can parents do to make sure that their children do not give in to peer pressure?</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Q. Teenagers are highly influenced by their friends. There is a term called 'peer pressure' meaning that a child is forced to behave in a manner that is acceptable to his/her friends. These behaviors may range from simple dress codes to drinking and smoking. What can parents do to make sure that their children do not give in to peer pressure? Explain and/or give examples of situations.</p><p id='p-2'>Teenagers are very susceptible to the opinions or thoughts of their friends. They are very cautious and sensitive in expressing themselves since they constantly pay much attention to their friends’ judgement or reaction with regard to their behaviors. In this essay, I will explain what parents are able to make their kids be free from the influence from their peer.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, I believe the first thing parents have to do to provide a good advise for the difficulty 'peer pressures' their kids are encountering in their school is that they have to bolster their children’s confidence and self esteem. There are several researches to prove that people who are less influenced by their friends usually have a tendency to have a strong confidence and self esteem. For instance, when I was middle school student, I had a very low self esteem. My main decison criteria was always what my friends think and feel since I felt that my friends’ judgement seems to be superior to mine. Therefore, I always have to behave the way to make my friends happy.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, parents need to teach their kids that there is no way to please all people around them. Teenagers usually want to make a good relationship with any friends. In doing so, they have to keep considering their friends’ need and expectation. For example, when I realized that I cannot satisfy all my friends’ expectation and furthermore sometimes it require my sacrifice which certainly make me unhappy. Therefore I can be much more free after I dicide to abandon some of my friends’ judgements or thoughts.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, it is quite meaningful for teenagers to realize what behaviors or thoughts can be acceptable to their peer. However parents also need to make an effort to teach their kids how to mingle with their friends without too much considering their friends’ expectation.</p>
