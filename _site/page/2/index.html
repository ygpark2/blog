            <p id='p-1'>Q.Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</p><p id='p-2'>As the world is becomming smaller thanks to globalization, people have a tendency to use only the languages which can be communicated globaly. Some people believe that a government’s intervention to deter the phenomenon of the disapearing languages is necessarily whereas other people argue that we can do many important matters which is much more crucial than the prevention of languages’ extinction. I believe that the goverment have to invest public money to develop polocies to protect the disappearance of languages.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, the argument that the goverment’s effort to save the languages spoken by minorities is wasteful do not make sense as the language is the most prominent invention human being developed. Supposing that we do not have such a minor language, basically we are denying and destroying every legacy the people of speaking the language developed. It is quite lamentable that the goverment do not take any action to preserve the minor languages which enrich our cultural variety and provide some precious knowledge to our next genrations to come.</p><p id='p-4'>On the other hand, basically the money we collected from people under the name of tax is supposed to spend for enhancing the public welfare. I cannot find any other option except the spent money for preserving the languagates in dager of disappearing since this will definately flourish our culture and extend our capacity of taking care of minorities eventually. Thus I strongly support the idea that we should persist the effort to preserve the disapearing languages and reach a consensus with regard to investing money on prevention of languages extinction since the money is based on tax payer’s money.</p><p id='p-5'>In summary, I believe the goverment need to take this issue seriously and raise public awareness about this issue so that more people can pay attention to this issue. As the public interests are growing rapidly, the solution for the problem of preserving the disapearing languages will be easily found or the task to achieve the goal will be relatively easier.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q. Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.</p><p id='p-2'>The purpose of museums has been quite controversial since the understanding of the purpose is sharply contrast amongst people. Some people believe that we need to fortify the role of education in museum whereas other people think that the entertainment purpose should be prioritized admong other roles. In this essay, I want to weigh the both views and add my thought about the issue.</p><p id='p-3'>It is widely considered that the paramount role of museum is to provide a variety of information about our ancestor to people as well as to record our present generation’s thought and living style in order to give a lesson to our next generation to come. This is the main reason why many schools harness the museum as a place to teach students. However, if we put too much stress on the role of education in museum, people will be easily losing their interesting, which come to the place where most people is very not keen to go very frequently. Thus I believe we need to come up with measures to encourage the students to learn many lessons or obtain valuable information without compromising their interest.</p><p id='p-4'>On the other hand, there is very strong tendency to utilize musuems as a place to hold many cultural performance events as the museum is quite suitable place to serve that purpose. As this kind of events are increasing, people often apt to forget why they come to the museum and only focus on the enjoyment the events give. I do not oppose the function of museum to give pleasure people through various mediums. However, if we lose the main purpose the museum, which is education, by mesmerizing those pleasures. we are actully denying the original reason for the existence of the museum.</p><p id='p-5'>In summary, museum is able to server a variety of purposes as long as it is faithfully serving the original role to educate people and preserve the legacy. Therefore, we need to be vigilant in order not to confuse the original functionalities of museum.</p>

What can individual people do?</p><p id='p-2'>Environment has been with us before human being appeared on the earth. we cannot live without the environment and the quality of life is heavily affected by the state of environment.

These companies are quite frequently caught due to the damage on the environment they incur. However, the penalty or punishment seems not strict enough to deter the recurrence of the violation the company committed. Thus we need to strengthen the punishment for any environmental violation as well as apply heavy punishment for the company which made the same crime again.</p><p id='p-5'>From the individual point of view,</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/11/24/university_equal_admission/">Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Q. Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</p><p id='p-2'>Some people believe that there should be no difference in the number of students in every subject regardless of their sexuality. However I personally believe if we focus on the equality of sex too much, we might have to sacrifice some the of values that we want to achieve through university education. I will highlight the values we can obtain in favor of the gender inequality in university.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, assuming that universities are obliged to accept people in equal proportion between men and women irrespective of their ability or competitiveness with regard to study, we might punish the people who are more competitive people because of gender equality. For example, a person who had a very high academic capability might have to give up the chance to develop his or her career to conduct further study in higher education. The less capable person in study will gain an admission from university thanks to the consideration to allocate equal ratio between men and women, which ultimately lead to making our education system worser and demotivating smart people to study in university.</p><p id='p-4'>Secondly, we have many universities allowed to give a chance for female only to study in Korea. If the argument that universities should consider the students’ gender in selecting students is justified, we are basically denying the justification of those universities’ existence since they fail to meet the very important requirement to accept equal gender ratio of students. However, those universities are showing a good academic achievement in teaching students and research a subject with only female students. From this case, we can see there is no corelation between the same number of men and women students and the consideration of gender equality in university will undermine the competitiveness of university.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, I am strongly convinced that we should abolish any constraints to restrict the admission of university because of their gender. If we not take any action to prevent this absurd regulation, we might have to face a disaster that people start to disregard the university and nobody want to pursue a study in higher education system.</p>
