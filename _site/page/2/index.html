            <h2 id='p-1'>Many people believe that social networking sites ( such as Facebook) have had a huge negative impact on both individuals and society. To what extend do you agree?</h2><p id='p-2'>The vast majority of people are convinced that the increasing number of social networking sites seems to have side effect on people as well as society in terms of a variety of aspect. However, there are a few people still believe that the online networking application have encourage people to meet a new person and facilitated the connection between people. My argument about this issue is that we need to maximize the benefits such sites can bring about and minimize the negative effects they might incur.</p><p id='p-3'>The first good point we can obtain in using those sites is that they actually make it easier to meet an unknown person. To elaborate more, as the society is more specialized, people are experiencing meeting new people within their speciality boundary. For example we have to spend most of our time in our workplace, it is quite hard to imagine that we ᅟare highly like to meet new people who are totally unrelated with our job. Thus, at these days, the sites are the only channel we can utilize to broaden our social relationship.</p><p id='p-4'>Another positive aspect of harnessing those sites is that especially the society which is suffering due to low birth rate might be able to overcome the issue easily through those sites. For instance, as more people take advantage ot the sites, the number of marriage couple will naturally increase thanks to the sites, which will eventually lead to the high birth rate. Therefore the society need to make an effort to raise an awareness of those sites and encourage them to use more frequently.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion, we can conclude that the social networking sites seems to be beneficially not only to our society but also to individuals</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programms (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children) What extent do you agree or disagree?</p><p id='p-2'>Some of the essential services in our community will not work properly without volunteers’ dedicated effort. I believe such volunteers have been educated about how important their works are and experienced how much pleasure they will receive in return for their work. Thus I totally agree with the idea to include the social service program to high school curriculum.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, we need to dwell on the several benefits from enforcing the course to ask the high school students to do social service without any financial compensation. The first thing they can obtain from the compelling social course is that they can fully enjoy the happyness money cannot give. For instance, one of my friends who had a strong idea to</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/10/18/ielt_writing_art_education.html/">Art is considered an important part of a society as well as an expressio nof its culture. Do you think it is important for children to be taught art? Do you think children should be encouraged to focus an art rather than other subjects?</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Art has been essential element of any human society from prehistoric times. However, at these days, the unprecedented technology development seems to undermine the value of art in human growth. I personally believe that art seems to be undervalued that is should deserve and we need to find a way to promote to the education of art in our public school.</p><p id='p-2'>First of all, as the increasing importance of creativity in many areas is receiving more attention, people tend to pay more attention to how to enhance their creativity. The most effective method to develop creativity has been the education of art since we can easily find the most creative person among the artists. In addition to this, art can also be used to cure a person who are psychologically damaged. Therefore, we can expect the benefits in terms of psychological aspect as well as develping creativity.</p><p id='p-3'>Even though the critical importance of art has been recoginized by an increasing number of people, the recognition with regard to art in our education system seems to be out of tune with public concerns. A big portion of our time in schools has been dedicated to teach other subjects by neglecting to spend more time to teach art. Furthermore, the exam to determine their ability to study in university to not include art subject, which eventually discourage students to study art.</p><p id='p-4'>In conclusion, we are living in the society or the education system that make little account of art subject. However, we have to build up a strong art education to foster more creative person.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>The importance of learning a foreign language is increasing, as the globalizatio nis expedited in many countries. In this trend, some language master argue that foreign language education should be taught at primary school in stead of secondary school to maximize the effectiveness of the education of language learning. However, I believe that secondary school is the best time to teach foreign language because we can expect more benefits.</p><p id='p-2'>The first advantage of teaching foreign language at secondary school is that the students can easily understand the meaning of foreign word thanks to their concrete and abundant mother tongue’s vocabulary. If you teach foreign language to a primary student who is not fully developed his or her navive language, it will be extremly hard because he or she cannot understand a new foreign word which he or she never learnt the corresponding word in his or her mother tongue. In addition to this, adding new language to their premature mother tongue will not only deter the development of their mother tongue but also be not helpful to learn a foreign language beased on their fragile mother tongue.</p><p id='p-3'>On contrary, if we teach a foreign language from elementary school, we can easily find many drawbacks. The first thing among them is that to teach foreign language to elementary studentswill be not only hard but not useful since it will be extremely difficult to motivate students who are still having trouble to understand their own language. Secondary, the early starting of teaching foreign language will destroy their interest as to foreign language, which will lead people to the stage of abandoning</p><p id='p-4'>To sum up, the disadvantages we expect from the teaching foreign language in elementary school seems to outweigh the advantages we can obtain from secondary school.</p>
