            <p id='p-1'>Q. Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behaviour. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</p><p id='p-2'>The view of cultural differences has been the controversial issue amongst people. Some people believe that visitors need to respect or abide by the local rules or tradition whereas other people believe that the country need to show more leniency to foreigners. I will contemplate both perspectives and add comment to the reasoned conclusion.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, as many people travel abroad thanks to the technical advances in aviation industry leading to lower the cost of flying , they will frequently encounter some difficulties that resulted in the cultural difference in foreign countries where they are traveling. Obvioulsy the first response will be embarrassment for most people in such cases. Thus the most effective way to minimize or ease the awkward circumstances is to learn the country, which you are about to travel, with regard to their culture and tradition in advance. Furthermore, it will help you to understand the country more deeply and enrich your travel.</p><p id='p-4'>On the flip side, when it comes to the underdeveloped countries, foreign tourists are accounting for the main resource of their income. In such cases, they seem to be more lenient for the visitors since their living need to heavily rely on the tourists’ expense. However if you try to take advantage of their attitude toward foreign tourists, it might cause an unwanted trouble, For instance, when I travel middle east countries, I freely took pictures of a woman who wear a hijab. The woman called police to accuse me of taking the picture of her. I did not know that it is strictly prohibited to take a picture of woman in middle east countries.</p><p id='p-5'>In conclusion,</p>

Not all the changes were successful but we learned from the failures too. However, some people still believe any change will not be favorable to their life so that they strongly resist chnage. I will discuss both perspectives and add my thought on the matter..</p><p id='p-4'>First of all, people who love to encounter change usually have had a number of good memories about change and these good memories are instensifying their favorable behaviour or decision toward change. For example, when I was an university student, IT technology was very popular and many expert predict that the IT jobs will be promising. On that account, I made up my mind to change my major from public adminitration to information communication technology and I am very content with the decision that I made at that time. This good consequence of the change seems to reinforce my action to positively react to change.</p><p id='p-5'>On the other hand, it is very obvious that most people do not want to embrace change. The paramount reason for people to resist to the change is that they do not want to face uncertanities in which the change might bring. For instance, when they are compelled to adapt to the new technology in the company they are working, they will be highly likely to dislike the situation since they are not sure about how much they can perform in the new field. Basically, they are not happy with the uncertainty inherent the circumstances</p><p id='p-6'>In conclusion, we can easily observe two response patterns to change which are</p><p id='p-7'>Not all changes were good.</p><p id='p-8'>Many changes over the years were not for the better.</p>

            <p id='p-1'>Q.Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</p><p id='p-2'>As the world is becomming smaller thanks to globalization, people have a tendency to use only the languages which can be communicated globaly. Some people believe that a government’s intervention to deter the phenomenon of the disapearing languages is necessarily whereas other people argue that we can do many important matters which is much more crucial than the prevention of languages’ extinction. I believe that the goverment have to invest public money to develop polocies to protect the disappearance of languages.</p><p id='p-3'>First of all, the argument that the goverment’s effort to save the languages spoken by minorities is wasteful do not make sense as the language is the most prominent invention human being developed. Supposing that we do not have such a minor language, basically we are denying and destroying every legacy the people of speaking the language developed. It is quite lamentable that the goverment do not take any action to preserve the minor languages which enrich our cultural variety and provide some precious knowledge to our next genrations to come.</p><p id='p-4'>On the other hand, basically the money we collected from people under the name of tax is supposed to spend for enhancing the public welfare. I cannot find any other option except the spent money for preserving the languagates in dager of disappearing since this will definately flourish our culture and extend our capacity of taking care of minorities eventually. Thus I strongly support the idea that we should persist the effort to preserve the disapearing languages and reach a consensus with regard to investing money on prevention of languages extinction since the money is based on tax payer’s money.</p><p id='p-5'>In summary, I believe the goverment need to take this issue seriously and raise public awareness about this issue so that more people can pay attention to this issue. As the public interests are growing rapidly, the solution for the problem of preserving the disapearing languages will be easily found or the task to achieve the goal will be relatively easier.</p>
