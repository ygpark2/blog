            <p id='p-1'>Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programms (for example working for a charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children) What extent do you agree or disagree?</p><p id='p-2'>Some of the essential services in our community will not work properly without volunteers’ dedicated effort. I believe such volunteers have been educated about how important their works are and experienced how much pleasure they will receive in return for their work. Thus I totally agree with the idea to include the social service program to high school curriculum.</p><p id='p-3'>Firstly, we need to dwell on the several benefit from enforcing the course to ask the high school students to do social service.</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/10/18/ielt_writing_art_education.html/">Art is considered an important part of a society as well as an expressio nof its culture. Do you think it is important for children to be taught art? Do you think children should be encouraged to focus an art rather than other subjects?</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>Art has been essential element of any human society from prehistoric times. However, at these days, the unprecedented technology development seems to undermine the value of art in human growth. I personally believe that art seems to be undervalued that is should deserve and we need to find a way to promote to the education of art in our public school.</p><p id='p-2'>First of all, as the increasing importance of creativity in many areas is receiving more attention, people tend to pay more attention to how to enhance their creativity. The most effective method to develop creativity has been the education of art since we can easily find the most creative person among the artists. In addition to this, art can also be used to cure a person who are psychologically damaged. Therefore, we can expect the benefits in terms of psychological aspect as well as develping creativity.</p><p id='p-3'>Even though the critical importance of art has been recoginized by an increasing number of people, the recognition with regard to art in our education system seems to be out of tune with public concerns. A big portion of our time in schools has been dedicated to teach other subjects by neglecting to spend more time to teach art. Furthermore, the exam to determine their ability to study in university to not include art subject, which eventually discourage students to study art.</p><p id='p-4'>In conclusion, we are living in the society or the education system that make little account of art subject. However, we have to build up a strong art education to foster more creative person.</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/10/18/ielt_writing_forein_langugage.html/">Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school Do you think advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>The importance of learning a foreign language is increasing, as the globalizatio nis expedited in many countries. In this trend, some language master argue that foreign language education should be taught at primary school in stead of secondary school to maximize the effectiveness of the education of language learning. However, I believe that secondary school is the best time to teach foreign language because we can expect more benefits.</p><p id='p-2'>The first advantage of teaching foreign language at secondary school is that the students can easily understand the meaning of foreign word thanks to their concrete and abundant mother tongue’s vocabulary. If you teach foreign language to a primary student who is not fully developed his or her navive language, it will be extremly hard because he or she cannot understand a new foreign word which he or she never learnt the corresponding word in his or her mother tongue. In addition to this, adding new language to their premature mother tongue will not only deter the development of their mother tongue but also be not helpful to learn a foreign language beased on their fragile mother tongue.</p><p id='p-3'>On contrary, if we teach a foreign language from elementary school, we can easily find many drawbacks. The first thing among them is that to teach foreign language to elementary studentswill be not only hard but not useful since it will be extremely difficult to motivate students who are still having trouble to understand their own language. Secondary, the early starting of teaching foreign language will destroy their interest as to foreign language, which will lead people to the stage of abandoning</p><p id='p-4'>To sum up, the disadvantages we expect from the teaching foreign language in elementary school seems to outweigh the advantages we can obtain from secondary school.</p>

        <h1><a href="/posts/2015/06/19/IELTS_wrting_1.html/">Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives.</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>At these days, advertisement is such an important matter in modern society since the purpose of advertisement is to influence people to take an expected action. As a result, more people are influenced by advertisement consciously or unconsciously. Thus I want to analyze the pros and cons of the advertisement.</p><p id='p-2'>Some people believe that advertisement have contributed tremendously to the development of our daily lives in terms of introducing very innovative product which radically change the way we live in a positive way. Moreover we are bombarded with a number of products which we cannot even recognize the products are on the market. Without the help of advertisement, it will be hard for us to choose a proper products which can serve our needs well. Therefore advertisement is necessary element in our life from the perspective of helping us to decide which product we should buy by providing a necessary information about the product to us.</p><p id='p-3'>However we also need to dwell on the possible consequence which an advertisement might bring to our daily lives. If we think about the purpose of advertisement which is to boost products’ consumption to increase a company’s profit, we can naturally estimate what kind of impact it will be. For example, the company only pursuing profit want to maximize the revenue by adopting an advertisement having mentally detrimental or toxic content to the target customers. Thus we should regulate the advertisement not considering the negative effect to people and censor the advertisement to prevent.</p><p id='p-4'>In conclusion, we have seen advertisement can be conducive to our life as long as it is controlled to enhance the function to provide information to customers and restrain the desire to pursue profit by neglecting the side effects.</p>
