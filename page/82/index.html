        <h1><a href="/posts/2014/02/12/Functional_Programming_in_Python_part1.html/">파이썬 함수형 언어 파트 1</a></h1>

        
            <p id='p-1'>가장 어려운 질문인 함수형 언어가 무엇인지로 시작하는게 좋을것 같습니다. 한가지 답변은 함수형 언어는 Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, ML, OCAML, Clean, Mercury 또는 Erlang 같은 언어로 프로그램을 짜는 것을 말합니다. 이것은 가장 확실한 답변이지만은 아주 분명하게 설명을 하지는 않은 것입니다. 불행히도, 함수형 언어가 무엇인지에 관한 일관된 의견을 가지는 것은 참 어려운 일입니다. 심지어 함수형 프로그래머들도 정확한 정의를 하지 못하고 있습니다. 장님과 코끼리 이야기가 여기에서 참 적절한 예인것 같습니다. «imperative languages» We’d better start with the hardest question: «What is functional programming (FP), anyway?» One answer would be to say that FP is what you do when you program in languages like Lisp, Scheme, Haskell, ML, OCAML, Clean, Mercury, or Erlang (or a few others). That is a safe answer, but not one that clarifies very much. Unfortunately, it is hard to get a consistent opinion on just what FP is, even from functional programmers themselves. A story about elephants and blind men seems apropos here. It is also safe to contrast FP with «imperative programming» (what you do in languages like C, Pascal, C++, Java, Perl, Awk, TCL, and most others, at least for the most part).</p><p id='p-2'>개인적으로 저는 적어도 다음과 같은 특징들을 가진 언어를 함수형 언어로 간주합니다. 함수형 언어라 불리는 언어는 다음과 같은 것들을 쉽게 하거나 다른 것들을 어렵거나 불가능하게 합니다. Personally, I would roughly characterize functional programming as having at least several of the following characteristics. Languages that get called functional make these things easy, and make other things either hard or impossible:</p><p id='p-3'>함수는 첫번째 클래스 또는 객체입니다. 즉 데이터를 가지고 할 수 있는 모든 것들을 함수로서도 할 수 있습니다. (예를 들면, 함수를 다른 함수의 인자로 넘기는 것과 같은 것들을 할 수 있어야 합니다.) Functions are first class (objects). That is, everything you can do with «data» can be done with functions themselves (such as passing a function to another function).</p><p id='p-4'>재귀는 주요 제어 구조 방식으로 사용됩니다. 어떤 언어에서는 «loop» 반복문이 없습니다. 단지 LISt Process(LISP라는 이름은 이곳에서 왔습니다)에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 리스트는 종종 «loop»반복문을 대체하기 위한 방법으로서 하위 리스트에 관한 재귀 반복문을 사용합니다. Recursion is used as a primary control structure. In some languages, no other «loop» construct exists. There is a focus on LISt Processing (for example, the name Lisp). Lists are often used with recursion on sub-lists as a substitute for loops.</p><p id='p-5'>순수 함수형 언어는 부작용들을 회피합니다. 이것은 선언적 언어들 어디에서나 볼수 있는 한 변수에 값을 할당하고 또다른 값을 할당해서 프로그램의 상태를 추적하는 패턴을 배제합니다. «Pure» functional languages eschew side-effects. This excludes the almost ubiquitous pattern in imperative languages of assigning first one, then another value to the same variable to track the program state.</p><p id='p-6'>함수형 언어는 FP either discourages or outright disallows statements, and instead works with the evaluation of expressions (in other words, functions plus arguments). In the pure case, one program is one expression (plus supporting definitions).</p><p id='p-7'>함수형 언어는 어떻게 계산 되어야 하는가보다는 무엇이 계산되어야 하는가에 초점을 맞춘다. 대부분의 함수형 언어는 «고차원 순서»함수 ( 다시 말해서 함수들에 기능하는 함수들에 또 다시 기능하는 함수들을 말한다. )를 이용한다. FP worries about what is to be computed rather than how it is to be computed. Much FP utilizes «higher order» functions (in other words, functions that operate on functions that operate on functions). Advocates of functional programming argue that all these characteristic make for more rapidly developed, shorter, and less bug-prone code. Moreover, high theorists of computer science, logic, and math find it a lot easier to prove formal properties of functional languages and programs than of imperative languages and programs. Inherent Python functional capabilities Python has had most of the characteristics of FP listed above since Python 1.0. But as with most Python features, they have been present in a very mixed language. Much as with Python’s OOP features, you can use what you want and ignore the rest (until you need it later). With Python 2.0, a very nice bit of «syntactic sugar» was added with list comprehensions. While list comprehensions add no new capability, they make a lot of the old capabilities look a lot nicer. The basic elements of FP in Python are the functions map(), reduce(), and filter(), and the operator lambda. In Python 1.x, the apply() function also comes in handy for direct application of one function’s list return value to another function. Python 2.0 provides an improved syntax for this purpose. Perhaps surprisingly, these very few functions (and the basic operators) are almost sufficient to write any Python program; specifically, the flow control statements (if, elif, else, assert, try, except, finally, for, break, continue, while, def) can all be handled in a functional style using exclusively the FP functions and operators. While actually eliminating all flow control commands in a program is probably only useful for entering an «obfuscated Python» contest (with code that will look a lot like Lisp), it is worth understanding how FP expresses flow control with functions and recursion. Back to top Eliminating flow control statements The first thing to think about in our elimination exercise is the fact that Python «short circuits» evaluation of Boolean expressions. This provides an expression version of if/ elif/ else blocks (assuming each block calls one function, which is always possible to arrange). Here’s how: Listing 1. «Short-circuit» conditional calls in Python</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'># Normal statement-based flow control
if &lt;cond1&gt;:   func1()
elif &lt;cond2&gt;: func2()
else:         func3()

# Equivalent "short circuit" expression
(&lt;cond1&gt; and func1()) or (&lt;cond2&gt; and func2()) or (func3())

# Example "short circuit" expression
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; def pr(s): return s
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x==1 and pr('one')) or (x==2 and pr('two')) or (pr('other'))
'other'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; (x==1 and pr('one')) or (x==2 and pr('two')) or (pr('other'))
'two'</code></pre><p id='p-8'>Our expression version of conditional calls might seem to be nothing but a parlor trick; however, it is more interesting when we notice that the lambda operator must return an expression. Since – as we have shown – expressions can contain conditional blocks via short-circuiting, a lambda expression is fully general in expressing conditional return values. Building on our example: Listing 2. Lambda with short-circuiting in Python</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; pr = lambda s:s
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum = lambda x: (x==1 and pr("one")) \
....                  or (x==2 and pr("two")) \
....                  or (pr("other"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(1)
'one'
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(2)
'two'
&gt;&gt;&gt; namenum(3)
'other'</code></pre><h2 id='p-9'>Functions as first class objects</h2><p id='p-10'>The above examples have already shown the first class status of functions in Python, but in a subtle way. When we create a function object with the lambda operation, we have something entirely general. As such, we were able to bind our objects to the names «pr» and «namenum», in exactly the same way we might have bound the number 23 or the string «spam» to those names. But just as we can use the number 23 without binding it to any name (in other words, as a function argument), we can use the function object we created with lambda without binding it to any name. A function is simply another value we might do something with in Python. The main thing we do with our first class objects, is pass them to our FP built-in functions map(), reduce(), and filter(). Each of these functions accepts a function object as its first argument. map() performs the passed function on each corresponding item in the specified list(s), and returns a list of results. reduce() performs the passed function on each subsequent item and an internal accumulator of a final result; for example, reduce(lambda n,m:n*m, range(1,10)) means «factorial of 10» (in other words, multiply each item by the product of previous multiplications). filter() uses the passed function to «evaluate» each item in a list, and return a winnowed list of the items that pass the function test. We also often pass function objects to our own custom functions, but usually those amount to combinations of the mentioned built-ins. By combining these three FP built-in functions, a surprising range of «flow» operations can be performed (all without statements, only expressions). Back to top</p><h2 id='p-11'>Functional looping in Python</h2><p id='p-12'>Replacing loops is as simple as was replacing conditional blocks. for can be directly translated to map(). As with our conditional execution, we will need to simplify statement blocks to single function calls (we are getting close to being able to do this generally): Listing 3. Replacing loops</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>for e in lst:  func(e)      # statement-based loop
map(func,lst)           # map()-based loop</code></pre><p id='p-13'>By the way, a similar technique is available for a functional approach to sequential program flow. That is, imperative programming mostly consists of statements that amount to «do this, then do that, then do the other thing.» map() lets us do just this: Listing 4. Map-based action sequence</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'># let's create an execution utility function
do_it = lambda f: f()

# let f1, f2, f3 (etc) be functions that perform actions

map(do_it, [f1,f2,f3])   # map()-based action sequence</code></pre><p id='p-14'>In general, the whole of our main program can be a map() expression with a list of functions to execute to complete the program. Another handy feature of first class functions is that you can put them in a list. Translating while is slightly more complicated, but is still possible to do directly: Listing 5. Functional 'while' looping in Python</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'># statement-based while loop
while &lt;cond&gt;:
    &lt;pre-suite&gt;
    if &lt;break_condition&gt;:
        breakelse:
        &lt;suite&gt;

# FP-style recursive while loop
def while_block():
    &lt;pre-suite&gt;
    if &lt;break_condition&gt;:
        return 1
    else:
        &lt;suite&gt;
    return 0

while_FP = lambda: (&lt;cond&gt; and while_block()) or while_FP()
while_FP()</code></pre><p id='p-15'>Our translation of while still requires a while_block() function that may itself contain statements rather than just expressions. But we might be able to apply further eliminations to that function (such as short circuiting the if/else in the template). Also, it is hard for "raw" (line 1, column 446):
unexpected end of input
expecting "&", "&lt;![CDATA[", "&lt;?", "&lt;!--", "&lt;" or "&lt;/"</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'># imperative version of "echo()"
def echo_IMP():
    while 1:
        x = raw_input("IMP -- ")
        if x == 'quit':
            breakelseprint x
echo_IMP()

# utility function for "identity with side-effect"
def monadic_print(x):
    print x
    return x

# FP version of "echo()"
echo_FP = lambda: monadic_print(raw_input("FP -- "))=='quit' or echo_FP()
echo_FP()</code></pre><p id='p-16'>What we have accomplished is that we have managed to express a little program that involves I/O, looping, and conditional statements as a pure expression with recursion (in fact, as a function object that can be passed elsewhere if desired). We do still utilize the utility function monadic_print(), but this function is completely general, and can be reused in every functional program expression we might create later (it’s a one-time cost). Notice that any expression containing monadic_print(x)evaluates to the same thing as if it had simply contained x. FP (particularly Haskell) has the notion of a «monad» for a function that «does nothing, and has a side-effect in the process.»</p><p id='p-17'>Eliminating side-effects After all this work in getting rid of perfectly sensible statements and substituting obscure nested expressions for them, a natural question is «Why?!» All of my descriptions of FP are achieved in Python. But the most important characteristic?and the one likely to be concretely useful?is the elimination of side-effects (or at least their containment to special areas like monads). A very large percentage of program errors?and the problem that drives programmers to debuggers?occur because variables obtain unexpected values during the course of program execution. Functional programs bypass this particular issue by simply not assigning values to variables at all. Let’s look at a fairly ordinary bit of imperative code. The goal here is to print out a list of pairs of numbers whose product is more than 25. The numbers that make up the pairs are themselves taken from two other lists. This sort of thing is moderately similar to things that programmers actually do in segments of their programs. An imperative approach to the goal might look like: Listing 7. Imperative Python code for «print big products»</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'># Nested loop procedural style for finding big products
xs = (1,2,3,4)
ys = (10,15,3,22)
bigmuls = []
# ...more stuff...
for x in xs:
    for y in ys:
        # ...more stuff...
        if x*y &gt; 25:
            bigmuls.append((x,y))
            # ...more stuff...
# ...more stuff...
print bigmuls</code></pre><p id='p-18'>This project is small enough that nothing is likely to go wrong. But perhaps our goal is embedded in code that accomplishes a number of other goals at the same time. The sections commented with «more stuff» are the places where side-effects are likely to lead to bugs. At any of these points, the variables xs, ys, bigmuls, x, y might acquire unexpected values in the hypothetical abbreviated code. Furthermore, after this bit of code is done, all the variables have values that may or may not be expected and wanted by later code. Obviously, encapsulation in functions/instances and care regarding scope can be used to guard against this type of error. And you can always del your variables when you are done with them. But in practice, the types of errors indicated are common. A functional approach to our goal eliminates these side-effect errors altogether. A possible bit of code is: Listing 8. Functional approach to our goal bigmuls = lambda xs,ys: filter(lambda (x,y):x<em>y &gt; 25, combine(xs,ys)) combine = lambda xs,ys: map(None, xs</em>len(ys), dupelms(ys,len(xs))) dupelms = lambda lst,n: reduce(lambda s,t:s+t, map(lambda l,n=n: [l]*n, lst)) print bigmuls((1,2,3,4),(10,15,3,22)) We bind our anonymous (lambda) function objects to names in the example, but that is not strictly necessary. We could instead simply nest the definitions. For readability we do it this way; but also because combine() is a nice utility function to have anyway (produces a list of all pairs of elements from two input lists). dupelms() in turn is mostly just a way of helping out combine(). Even though this functional example is more verbose than the imperative example, once you consider the utility functions for reuse, the new code in bigmuls() itself is probably slightly less than in the imperative version. The real advantage of this functional example is that absolutely no variables change any values within it. There are no possible unanticipated side-effects on later code (or from earlier code). Obviously, the lack of side-effects, in itself, does not guarantee that the code is correct, but it is nonetheless an advantage. Notice, however, that Python (unlike many functional languages) does not prevent rebinding of the names bigmuls, combine and dupelms. If combine() starts meaning something different later in the program, all bets are off. You could work up a Singleton class to contain this type of immutable bindings (as, say, s.bigmuls and so on); but this column does not have room for that. One thing distinctly worth noticing is that our particular goal is tailor-made for a new feature of Python 2. Rather than either the imperative or functional examples given, the best (and functional) technique is:</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>print [(x,y) for x in (1,2,3,4) for y in (10,15,3,22) if x*y &gt; 25]</code></pre>

In ML-family languages, however, it is natural to create bindings within a single expression: Listing 2: Haskell expression-level name bindings <sub>~</sub>~~haskell – car (x:xs) = x – <em>could</em> create module-level binding list_of_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]</p><p id='p-6'>– 'where' clause for expression-level binding firsts1 = [car x | x &lt;- list_of_list] where car (x:xs) = x</p><p id='p-7'>– 'let' clause for expression-level binding firsts2 = let car (x:xs) = x in [car x | x &lt;- list_of_list]</p><p id='p-8'>– more idiomatic higher-order 'map' technique firsts3 = map car list_of_list where car (x:xs) = x</p><p id='p-9'>– Result: firsts1 == firsts2 == firsts3 == [1,4,7] <sub>~</sub>~~</p><p id='p-10'>Greg Ewing observed that it is possible to accomplish the same effect using Python’s list comprehensions; we can even do it in a way that is nearly as clean as Haskell’s syntax: Listing 3: Python 2.0+ expression-level name bindings <sub><sub><sub><s>python &gt;&gt;&gt; list_of_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] &gt;&gt;&gt; [car_x for x in list_of_list for car_x in (x[0],)][1, 4, 7] This trick of putting an expression inside a single-item tuple in a list comprehension does not provide any way of using expression-level bindings with higher-order functions. To use the higher-order functions, we still need to use block-level bindings, as with: Listing 4: Python block-level bindings with 'map()' &gt;&gt;&gt; list_of_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] &gt;&gt;&gt; let = Bindings() &gt;&gt;&gt; let.car = lambda l: l[0] &gt;&gt;&gt; map(let.car,list_of_list) [1, 4, 7]</s></sub></sub></sub></p><p id='p-11'>Not bad, but if we want to use map(), the scope of the binding remains a little broader than we might want. Nonetheless, it is possible to coax list comprehensions into doing our name bindings for us, even in cases where a list is not what we finally want: Listing 5: «Stepping down» from Python list comprehension <sub><sub><sub><s>haskell Compare Haskell expression: result = func car_car where car (x:xs) = x car_car = car (car list_of_list) func x = x + x^2</s></sub></sub></sub></p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; [func for x in list_of_list

What these functions do – and the reason we call them «higher-order» – is take other functions as (some of) their arguments. Other higher-order functions, but not these built-ins, return function objects. Python has always given users the ability to construct their own higher-order functions by virtue of the first-class status of function objects. A trivial case might look like this: Listing 7: Trivial Python function factory <sub><sub><sub><s>python &gt;&gt;&gt; def foo_factory(): … def foo(): … print «Foo function from factory» … return foo … &gt;&gt;&gt; f = foo_factory() &gt;&gt;&gt; f()</s></sub></sub></sub></p><h2 id='p-15'>Foo function from factory</h2><p id='p-16'>The Xoltar Toolkit, which I discussed in Part 2 of this series, comes with a nice collection of higher-order functions. Most of the functions that Xoltar’s functional module provides are ones developed in various traditionally functional languages, and whose usefulness have been proven over many years. Possibly the most famous and most important higher-order function is curry(). curry() is named after the logician Haskell Curry, whose first name is also used to name the above-mentioned programming language. The underlying insight of «currying» is that it is possible to treat (almost) every function as a partial function of just one argument. All that is necessary for currying to work is to allow the return value of functions to themselves be functions, but with the returned functions «narrowed» or «closer to completion.» This works quite similarly to the closures I wrote about in Part 2 – each successive call to a curried return function «fills in» more of the data involved in a final computation (data attached to a procedure). Let’s illustrate currying first with a very simple example in Haskell, then with the same example repeated in Python using the functional module: Listing 8: Currying a Haskell computation computation a b c d = (a + b^2+ c^3 + d^4) check = 1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + 5^4</p><pre class='sourceCode haskell'><code class='sourceCode haskell'>fillOne   = computation 1
-- specify "a"
fillTwo   = fillOne 2
-- specify "b"
fillThree = fillTwo 3
-- specify "c"
answer    = fillThree 5
-- specify "d"
-- Result: check == answer == 657</code></pre><p id='p-17'>Now in Python: Listing 9: Currying a Python computation <sub>~</sub>~~python &gt;&gt;&gt; from functional import curry &gt;&gt;&gt; computation = lambda a,b,c,d: (a + b<strong>2 + c</strong>3 + d**4) &gt;&gt;&gt; computation(1,2,3,5) 657 &gt;&gt;&gt; fillZero = curry(computation) &gt;&gt;&gt; fillOne = fillZero(1) # specify «a» &gt;&gt;&gt; fillTwo = fillOne(2) # specify «b» &gt;&gt;&gt; fillThree = fillTwo(3) # specify «c» &gt;&gt;&gt; answer = fillThree(5) # specify «d» &gt;&gt;&gt; answer 657 <sub>~</sub>~~</p><p id='p-18'>It is possible to further illustrate the parallel with closures by presenting the same simple tax-calculation program used in Part 2 (this time using curry()): Listing 10: Python curried tax calculations</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>from functional import *

But note that functional also contains an rcurry() class that will start at the other end (right to left). The second print statement in the example at one level is a trivial spelling change from simply calling the normal taxcalc(50000,0.30,10000). In a different level, however, it makes rather clear the concept that every function can be a function of just one argument – a rather surprising idea to those new to it.</p><h2 id='p-20'>Miscellaneous higher-order functions</h2><p id='p-21'>Beyond the «fundamental» operation of currying, functional provides a grab-bag of interesting higher-order functions. Moreover, it is really not hard to write your own higher-order functions – either with or without functional. The ones in functional provide some interesting ideas, at the least. For the most part, higher-order functions feel like «enhanced» versions of the standard map(), filter(), and reduce(). Often, the pattern in these functions is roughly «take a function or functions and some lists as arguments, then apply the function(s) to list arguments.» There are a surprising number of interesting and useful ways to play on this theme. Another pattern is «take a collection of functions and create a function that combines their functionality.» Again, numerous variations are possible. Let’s look at some of what functional provides. The functions sequential() and also() both create a function based on a sequence of component functions. The component functions can then be called with the same argument(s). The main difference between the two is simply that sequential() expects a single list as an argument, while also() takes a list of arguments. In most cases, these are useful for function side effects, but sequential() optionally lets you choose which function provides the combined return value: Listing 11: Sequential calls to functions (with same args)</p><pre class='sourceCode python'><code class='sourceCode python'>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a(x):
...     print x,
...     return "a"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x):
...     print x*2,
...     return "b"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; def c(x):
...     print x*3,
...     return "c"
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; r = also(a,b,c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; r
&lt;functional.sequential instance at 0xb86ac&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; r(5)
5 10 15
'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; sequential([a,b,c],main=c)('x')
x xx xxx
'c'</code></pre><p id='p-22'>The functions disjoin() and conjoin() are similar to sequential() and also() in terms of creating new functions that apply argument(s) to several component functions. But disjoin() asks whether any component functions return true (given the argument(s)), and conjoin() asks whether all components return true. Logical shortcutting is applied, where possible, so some side effects might not occur with disjoin(). joinfuncs() is similar to also(), but returns a tuple of the components’ return values rather than selecting a main one. Where the previous functions let you call multiple functions with the same argument(s), any(), all(), and none_of() let you call the same function against a list of arguments. In general structure, these are a bit like the built-in map(), reduce(), filter() functions. But these particular higher-order functions from functional ask Boolean questions about collections of return values. For example: Listing 12: Ask about collections of return values <sub>~</sub>~~python &gt;&gt;&gt; from functional import * &gt;&gt;&gt; isEven = lambda n: (n%2 == 0) &gt;&gt;&gt; any([1,3,5,8], isEven) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; any([1,3,5,7], isEven) 0 &gt;&gt;&gt; none_of([1,3,5,7], isEven) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; all([2,4,6,8], isEven) 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; all([2,4,6,7], isEven) 0 <sub>~</sub>~~</p><p id='p-23'>A particularly interesting higher-order function for those with a little bit of mathematics background is compose(). The composition of several functions is a «chaining together» of the return value of one function to the input of the next function. The programmer who composes several functions is responsible for making sure the outputs and inputs match up – but then, that is true any time a programmer uses a return value. A simple example makes it clear: Listing 13: Creating compositional functions <sub>~</sub>~~python &gt;&gt;&gt; def minus7(n): return n-7 … &gt;&gt;&gt; def times3(n): return n*3 … &gt;&gt;&gt; minus7(10) 3 &gt;&gt;&gt; minustimes = compose(times3,minus7) &gt;&gt;&gt; minustimes(10) 9 &gt;&gt;&gt; times3(minus7(10)) 9 &gt;&gt;&gt; timesminus = compose(minus7,times3) &gt;&gt;&gt; timesminus(10) 23 &gt;&gt;&gt; minus7(times3(10)) 23 <sub>~</sub>~~</p>
